But I also want to mention that once you graduate you can work as a veterinary assistant to see if being a vet will be the right pick for you. 

YouTube is a good way to get exposure as well since working isn‚Äôt an option yet!|Oh gosh, this has to be stressed!! Clients who are severely uneducated and accidentally injure/kill their pets in the process.

I read a story from an old facebook post where a woman put salt in her dog‚Äôs water bowl to prevent it from freezing and in return, accidentally killed him from sodium poisoning. You just can‚Äôt make this stuff up.",Other

They told me I was wasting my degree, that I‚Äôd lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don‚Äôt regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

Then at least you'd be getting paid.

According-Anybody-91,"Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo.

One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations.

dicidhdd_djdj,"As a medical doctor, I've noticed a troubling parallel between our fields regarding respect. Veterinary medicine, much like human medicine, demands rigorous training and dedication. Yet, vets often face significant disrespect in their workplace. They are highly skilled professionals, but their contributions are frequently undervalued. This lack of recognition can lead to burnout and job dissatisfaction. Both medical and veterinary professionals deserve respect and appreciation for their critical roles in healthcare. It's crucial to address these issues to improve morale and job satisfaction in both fields.",Medical Doctor
