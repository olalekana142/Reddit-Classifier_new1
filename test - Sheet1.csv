But I also want to mention that once you graduate you can work as a veterinary assistant to see if being a vet will be the right pick for you. 

YouTube is a good way to get exposure as well since working isn’t an option yet!|Oh gosh, this has to be stressed!! Clients who are severely uneducated and accidentally injure/kill their pets in the process.

I read a story from an old facebook post where a woman put salt in her dog’s water bowl to prevent it from freezing and in return, accidentally killed him from sodium poisoning. You just can’t make this stuff up.",Other

ACatOfTheCanals,"I worked a year in GP, feeling the same dread and anxiety you did. It sucked. The anxiety and self-doubt I felt every day was terrible. The only thing that helped me was having a wonderful support system outside of work, AND working at a clinic that had zero tolerance for toxicity. 

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don’t regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

At the end of that year, I bid GP goodbye forever and am now working as an IHE vet and am more content with my life choices than ever. |I just wanted to chime in with a slightly different experience. While it may be very true that, for you, it’s just this clinic that is the problem—it’s also possible that maybe it is general practice itself that you aren’t comfortable with.

I spent a year, miserable, in GP. I actually had a relatively supportive mentor and pretty friendly staff. I was just terrified, everyday, of making a mistake. It was all-consuming. I was miserable on my days off. I would stress about patients when I was home. I hated that appointment times were so short, and that I had to treat each patient and owner so briefly. I knew two months into GP that it was a bad fit. Family and friends told me to stick it out. They told me it was just this clinic; if I went somewhere else, somewhere with more support, then I’d have an easier time with it and learn to live with it. 

Literally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn’t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case—the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.

I stuck it out for the full year though—not because I wasn’t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn’t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I’d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

I took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health. I’ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable. 

That’s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.|I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally.

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don’t regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

At the end of that year, I bid GP goodbye forever and am now working as an IHE vet and am more content with my life choices than ever. |I just wanted to chime in with a slightly different experience. While it may be very true that, for you, it’s just this clinic that is the problem—it’s also possible that maybe it is general practice itself that you aren’t comfortable with.

I spent a year, miserable, in GP. I actually had a relatively supportive mentor and pretty friendly staff. I was just terrified, everyday, of making a mistake. It was all-consuming. I was miserable on my days off. I would stress about patients when I was home. I hated that appointment times were so short, and that I had to treat each patient and owner so briefly. I knew two months into GP that it was a bad fit. Family and friends told me to stick it out. They told me it was just this clinic; if I went somewhere else, somewhere with more support, then I’d have an easier time with it and learn to live with it. 

Literally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn’t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case—the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.

I stuck it out for the full year though—not because I wasn’t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn’t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I’d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

I took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health. I’ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable. 

That’s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.|I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally. I now work for an in-home euthanasia service, and I feel very fulfilled. It’s a much better fit.|I worked a year in GP, feeling the same dread and anxiety you did. It sucked.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.|I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER.

Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way.

Able_Stomach_,"Spaying can be a difficult procedure, especially for beginners. Here are some tips and tricks that you may find helpful:

* **Find a mentor:** One of the best things you can do is find a more experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician who can mentor you and guide you through the process. They can answer your questions, provide feedback on your technique, and help you troubleshoot any problems you encounter.
* **Start with small animals:** If you're new to surgery, it's a good idea to start with smaller animals, such as kittens or puppies. This will allow you to gain experience and confidence before moving on to larger animals.
* **Practice on models:** There are a number of surgical models available that you can use to practice your technique. This can be a great way to get comfortable with the instruments and procedures before you operate on a live animal.
* **Watch videos:** There are many great videos available online that can teach you about spaying. Look for videos that are specifically geared towards beginners.
* **Take a course:** There are a number of courses available that can teach you about spaying. These courses can be a great way to learn from experienced professionals and get hands-on experience.

Then at least you'd be getting paid. Once you prove yourself to be a good employee, you can see about transferring to the assistant position.|They're going to want to see evidence that you are reliable (show up on time? not call out for frivolous reasons?), have good common sense, and plan to stick around for a while. They're not going to want to invest time training someone then have them quit a week or two later once they learn that kennels are noisy and there's lots of poop to clean up.

To prepare, think of a few examples of times in the past where you've demonstrated responsibility, stuck with something despite periods of difficulty, or shown good observational skills that helped prevent a problem.

According-Anybody-91,"Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything.

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo.

One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!",Veterinarian

If they have trouble at the time of visit, help owners prioritize what to do first, but at the end of the day focus on the overall health of the pet recommwnd everything the pet needs, don't worry about the cost, that's not on you.|Oh, and a non salary related tip. It's OK to say I don't know. Owners respect that. ""I don't know, but this is how we can find out"" is powerful. Just lay out the game plan for the owners. If you believe in the plan, so will they. If you don't believe it yourself, you can't convince others its the right plan|This is the way",Veterinarian

dicidhdd_djdj,"As a medical doctor, I've noticed a troubling parallel between our fields regarding respect. Veterinary medicine, much like human medicine, demands rigorous training and dedication. Yet, vets often face significant disrespect in their workplace. They are highly skilled professionals, but their contributions are frequently undervalued. This lack of recognition can lead to burnout and job dissatisfaction. Both medical and veterinary professionals deserve respect and appreciation for their critical roles in healthcare. It's crucial to address these issues to improve morale and job satisfaction in both fields.",Medical Doctor
