"Anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar. There  simply isn't a veterinarian with as much experience as this MD.

"I can't help with the first bit - as I'm sure there are plenty of others more qualified than myself to provide better advice here.  


However, with the second half around surgeons.  
My best advice here is to come from their position & understanding, and meet that in your advance and behaviour. Being surgeons - they've gone through (likely) a Bachelors, then a 4 year Doctorate, then a 1+ year internship, a 4 year residency, and then spent X number of years in a specialisation. When you have that much education under your belt, sometimes things can seem obvious, or are natural to you (from practice and/or also being held to certain standards), that are not obvious or natural to others, particularly vet nurses, and hospital orderlies (which where I am, can exist from zero formal education, through to bachelors in general surgery), which even at the highest form of training, is about 9 years of education & specificity below that of the surgeon.  


Knowing basic things, being able to predict what comes next, being able to notice the small things, and being consistent & solid in your approach. If they ask for tape - ensuring the tape is the correct length for whatever they're planning to do. Know procedures, so when they ask for suture, you don't have to ask which one (unless it's weird, and alternative & needs a double check - in which case make it clear it's double checking).   


In my experience working with surgeons, it's less so that they're directly aggressive, but it is that they want quality work, to meet the standards they have set not only for you, but for themselves. When they are trying to do complex things, they don't want to have to be worrying about how or who is holding an animal.  


That doesn't excuse the relatively common behaviour of being a stick of dynamite behind the scenes (in which case, I just say move practices - it's not your job to fix them), particularly to those in training - however, ensuring that you are thorough and thoughtful in and about your job should show through. Keep in mind they've probably stood where you're standing at some point, quite a few vets started as vet nurses (and have hours in the job), and it can get very frustrating very quickly if you have to think for two, instead of one (particularly on the basics), particularly if it is the basics they're working on.|Full disclosure, am vet student, not vet nurse - but these are the areas that I regularly poke and see what falls out.

\- Depending on where you got your certification, you can often access library memberships as an alumnus. They will have a wealth of stuff that you can use.

\- Googling vet tech CPD and/or continuing education should yield more results than I can provide- Instagram, I follow a few vet techs & vets on there that post interesting cases (doesn't qualify for CPD, but it helps me expand knowledge).

\- If you are registered, your registrar should also have access to databases with your membership. If you have a topic of interest - throw it into google scholar, see what comes up.

\- Doing smaller side-courses, if you're not already a registered RVT, then doing that as an upskill, or even going on to do further vocational training in specialised areas can be relatively short in duration, but very good for further understanding. 

\- If you don't see yourself returning to practice any time soon, looking at Bachelors in the area 

\- Science, Animal Science, Nutrition, Biology, Biochemistry, Animal Behaviour, and so forth can really open up and broaden understanding. Quite a few uni's actually release their courses (without the certification at the end) to the public, which you may find useful to go through.

\- There are also plenty of areas that are available for free - Osmosis (through data bases), Youtube - Khan Academy, Ninja Nerd, Crash Course. Outside of this - Anki, textbooks, and just sourcing general stuff. Ninja Nerd actually goes nearly to the full depth of my degree itself when it comes to bio knowledge. It can't teach you to vet, but it can teach you the underlying bioscience to a well and truly solid level. We do go a little further (dysfunction, changes in dysfunction and so forth, before heading to diagnostics & treatment), but it will give you the in-health level.

E: Someone else also mentioned VIN - which absolutely as well. They provide free access if you're in a related course of study too, which depending on where you are in the world, can include online self-paced courses. Just a tid bit.|I double this

There will also be emails and other methods of communication with the advisory team that don’t require in-person contact.

We just went through an accreditation, and as well as having student boards, open hours, and walk-through, there were other methods of anonymous (which you could double up by using a second/throwaway email and so forth) communication.|There is definitely a place for you in vet med. However, only you can make the decision of whether or not you are happy to take up that place. There are plenty of more direct, less enduring careers that may make you as happy - and it's ok to ask if vet is worth it.  


Without even getting into specifics - vet med is short of everything, everywhere at the moment. Every vet student counts in building back up numbers, and restoring staffing shortages. The numbers shortage is so critical that even areas such as governmental departments are facing shortages - let alone more complex/demanding fields such as research or pathology.  
Vet school also does tend to have a narrow field of view too in my experience, where people are boxed into ""largies"" and ""smallies"". Half the people who answer are just answering for the sake of it. Others are genuine in their interest. Good chance a 2/3 also have no idea what is available outside those answers. It can often make it seem pretty naive, or simple - leaving you questioning if you're overthinking things. You're not - you've just got a different perspective you can bring to the table.  


I would also reassess whether or not you are burnt out - vet school is not easy, it's not well balanced and you're often left questioning things, even if you can't see an issue. It's partially the nature of it. It's such a demanding degree, that has such a high requirement of people in order to complete.   


I also want to mention the general toxicity that is veterinary hospitals - and for some reason, university hospitals. So many are just straight up horrible places to be. So much so if you scroll down on here it's a regular post from people actively doing placements from within them. It seems to be a shared item too, even from people who haven't actively posted. Every vet seems to have a story about someone who would just casually lose their temper (or be a narcissistic egotistical asshole), within a hospital placement. I can't answer to why, but residents are often the bottom of the trough to begin with relating to work (unfortunately), I'm willing to bet they're feeling it and passing it onto the students.|What stage of education are you at?Can you look elsewhere? What are your chances of getting into vet school in reality? (have you completed dip/bach/mast, research, other hours? other experience? local vet schools?)

It might sound backwards, but I worked hospitality up and am still in it whilst in Vet school.Use your hours and your time wisely. A higher wage opens up hours if you stay on the same total yearly income. It opens up time - which you can then use to diversify. Increased diversity also allows opening up opportunities outside of s/n.

Spay & neuter is good, I won't lie, but you need more than that to get into vet school, and you need more than that to eventually do it well. It's OK to do 37-40h a week, but diversify.

Being that you do 37-40h, I'm assuming you're not in continuing education too? Which again, can be another consideration on things. Vet schools will not look badly IF you have a continuing education with a non-industry related job.  


E: I Just want to add too, S/N tend to be community programs, so do tend to be low paid, low diversity, low growth jobs - these are good entry level positions, but if you want to get into vet school looking beyond this is necessary to an extent. They want well rounded candidates that are aware of the stresses & effort the field demands - this is part of the reason behind things like hours, research, and so forth. They want candidates that are already actively participating, and are not only educated but aware of the efforts it requires. Yes, S/N is good as it's high volume work - good hours, good surgical exposure, but it's only one area of a multifaceted profession.|A couple of things to consider  


\- As WeaselWarrior said, if you're fine with the aspects of problems & people - then you're probably fine. However, it is a large financial burden to take on. It's worth looking internationally at what is available, and where you would like to be. I also would look to where you're at, and look at how much you're involved with the medicine side of things, and see where you feel you stand with that - veterinary is literally medical, and one thing that I wasn't exposed to as much as other areas was how medical it would be (I don't have a problem with that & is one of those areas that I love - but it can shock people & be one of the main reasons of dropping out for those who don't get that experience prior).  


If you can, get experience (even just shadowing) in a clinic, and get a really good look at the life. Really go for it, and see. However, at the end of the day completing a DVM is different living in the profession.  
The other thing I thought through when I looked at doing my degree (internationally accredited DVM) was, if I were to leave the profession where would my DVM get me, versus other avenues. With my DVM, I can move laterally into research, I can take on governmental jobs, move internationally, continue through to residencies & specialisation, I can move into advisory roles and so forth. I could also move into areas that would be classically covered by a JD/business degree too (I'm Aussie - so it's a bit easier here). I can't do that with a PhD in some niche, or a second bachelors. Is it perhaps what I want? Not necessarily right now, but as an option for a parachute, you can't deny it's style with versatility.  


There's also nothing saying you can't do coding on the side - the biggest difference between my life pre-DVM and now is that my side hustles and hobbies were TO get into the DVM. I was also doing stupid hours on stupid hours volunteering, finding anything to get experience for the DVM. Now I'm there - I have time to do other things (sometimes!!), such as learning to invest on the stock market, and am now playing with shorts on sim. Once you're a vet, you may have time to do other things. There is a hustle culture in veterinary so this may get backlash - but at the end of the day, as a vet - you don't need to do that internship/specialisation, you don't necessarily need to constantly look at other things, you can walk away at the end of your shift and do something else. The time that is now spent non-degree working, that's ""free time"" once you're a vet. You can do something else there. Add in some of the recent improvements in compensation and if you were willing to stay in your current lifestyle, you could probably do a degree on the side (if you can get into a DVM, you can do another bach).  


It could be worth chatting with a uni careers advisor, or a counsellor too - to get an impartial opinion. Not family, not friends, not other vets (all a mixed bag, but none unbiased).|If you like shadowing, then you should be pretty right for the job itself. Particularly if there's few limitations to what you currently do/see/participate in.  


The one thing I would absolutely stress, to both yourself and anyone reading this - is even when in vet med, don't give up your hobbies. Yes, it demands so much but I think one of the biggest problems at the moment in the industry is people forget it is a job - not a lifestyle. I'm only a vet student, but we are constantly drilled to have other hobbies & passions, and life outside the course. It's easy to slip up and turn 100% med, but to have that option & outlet is crucial as it makes a huge difference to QOL. I also know I'm not alone in this opinion, and not alone in sectioning off time to work on hobbies & external interests.  
One of the areas vet med lacks too is proper IT and streamlining programs, so who knows - you may be able to use those skills more readily than what you think.  


Definitely chat with as many people as you can, particularly those ""knowing"" the industry, but not fully in it. Get as many opinions, then sort through them. You don't have to listen to them, but use them as thought & planning seeds.  


I can't answer for US college fees - again I'm Aussie - and I was lucky enough to do both my degrees CSP, with a bursary from one uni, and a couple of other things thrown in (and with a steady well paying job in hospo that compliments hours that I've worked up to senior positions), but all I can say is do the math, look at everything that is available, and see where to go. Not so much ""do your own research"" but do the footwork, make contacts, and research inside and out then get advice from that. I'm not the first person in my family to get tertiary study, but I am the first to go to this extent with Bachelors/doctorates/masters, etc. - and having supports makes a huge amount of difference, even if they aren't necessarily family/friends.  
I don't know the average cost of a degree in the US, nor what else is available to you, but I also would stress to look at scholarships and what it would take to get things such as partial or majority $$ paid for (including international). I would also crunch average salaries, and see how much financially it would take - and if it would be worth it. I would however stress not to auto-fall back on coding, as at the moment they can be hit & miss with workforce supply, and it's as much connections due to being a relatively limited industry (every industry has it's warts).  
It could be worth making connections in subs & in person at uni's you're looking at targeting too, even heading in and seeing what people suggest in regards to scholarships and such.

I think we can all agree that it is statistically improbable for the reports to contain everything for another student except their score or pass/fail status. 

But even if this were true, Name and ID information alone is enough for me to look up someone else’s score through the system. 

For example. If I knew someone’s name from my class and ICVA number, I could easily look up their birthday on the internet and log into the system and see if they passed and access their score report. I’m obviously not going to do that, but the fact that they are dismissing the information they did leak as unimportant shows their ignorance because the issue is less about the score or pass/fail.

"I’ll try not to repeat what’s already been said. 

Don’t be afraid to ask questions. About medications, procedures, tests, diagnoses, what you’re seeing on a radiograph/ultrasound, etc. Some of my coworkers keep around a small notebook to write down things they might forget (such as what to ask while taking a history in a vaccine vs sick appointment). If you don’t get the chance to ask a question, look it up when you next get the chance (or write it down to ask later).

Also learn about the software that’s used for appointments ASAP. Learn how to make appointments, where to access patient history, and how to make estimates and invoices. 

Good luck!|I’m sorry, but they have someone that has only been working for 2 months to be the sole assistant during the weekend?? And in surgery no less???

Your perspective would be incredibly valuable as I weigh my options for potential migration.

Thank you in advance for any information you can provide!",Other

Veterinary school does not prepare you for practice - teaching hospitals full of specialists and most of them have never stepped into the shoes of a GP and would shit themselves if they had to.

"Love for zoology and biology mostly. I also liked medicine so it helped. I realised quickly that there wouldnt be many job opportunities in zoology so i settled for veterinary instead (with zoology being more of a hobby now)


I should also add that i live in greece, so there isnt any school debt and vetmed doesnt require a degree to get into, its just a 5year degree. So i did one year in biology and switched to vetmed. I dont know if i would recommend what i did in america knowing the huge debt situation",Other

I highly recommend you read up on ethics in veterinary medicine before pursuing a career in it.|Well, as they say, you can lead a horse to water...|Lots of great responses here.

I'll add my story. The day I decided to become a vet was after dinner at my parents. I was 25, nearing the end of my masters and the next step would have been a PhD but I didn't want that. As I was leaving, a thought struck me:

I'm going to apply to vet med. 

And that's what I did. It wasn't some life long desire. It was a whim. A passing thought. That took root and grew like a weed. I liked medicine. That's what I wanted to do. So I did it and it worked out.

It doesn't have to be a big dream! It can be exactly what you want right now. For the record I very much disliked vet school and live clinical practice.|Absolutely! I love it. ❤️

This is because we are doing them a kindness and relieving suffering. While I do cry during euths it's sympathy tears, I don't carry those with me through the day. Euthanasia is an essential service and probably most important aspect of my job. I actually like that we can relieve suffering this way in animal medicine. One of my many reasons for being a vet is to help suffering animal. Death is a part if life. If I can ease their passage I have done good. For this reason Euthanasias have never been hard on me. I never carry it as a burden. It's not meant to be seen as such IMO.

The hard part is when an animal is sick and owners don't want to do anything about it and let the suffering continue.|I'm 5 years out and still ask tons of questions! I learn so much everyday. I also make mistakes too. We're human. You just gotta keep learning and growing.

As the kids say ""it's totally extra"". I'm living my best life for me and my kid. She and family are priority and I love this mental shift. Before I was burnt out, so tired of work. I'm refreshed and have put way less pressure on myself. I'm having fun again, working less, and spending more time with her.

I don't know what you mean by ""advancing"" in your career. Unless you are wanting or planning on specialty taking a year (or more) off at this point isn't going to hurt you. You've got the skills, you've got the experience, you've got the credentials. Vets are in demand, you won't be any less valuable after you take time to have your baby.|Well, you can't be good at everything and practice takes time. I've been out 5 years and can't place an iv catheter to save anyone's life. You'll have your strengths and your weaknesses that's why we work as a team. I couldn't do it without my techs, they couldn't do it without me. We all help each other.

Oh and you'll have your good days and bad. Some days you'll miss every poke and that's just the way thar cookie crumbles.|Lol the techs have given me more than one 🫣🤦‍♀️ on many occasion when I try to ""help"" them with their tasks.|Nearly everyone in our class started in their mid-20s.

Thats because most students in NA complete a 4 year bachelor degree then go to vet school. Many also take a year or two to work, complete a masters, or need multiple application cycles to get in. I think the majority of us were 22-26 in our class. I was 25. Youngest was 20, oldest was 32. 

You would be exactly average, lol.|That's literally all that our intake interview was about: difficult ethical choices. Sometimes, there is no good choice. I highly recommend you read up on ethics in veterinary medicine before pursuing a career in it.|Well, as they say, you can lead a horse to water...|Lots of great responses here.

I'll add my story. The day I decided to become a vet was after dinner at my parents. I was 25, nearing the end of my masters and the next step would have been a PhD but I didn't want that. As I was leaving, a thought struck me:

I'm going to apply to vet med. 

And that's what I did. It wasn't some life long desire. It was a whim. A passing thought. That took root and grew like a weed. I liked medicine. That's what I wanted to do. So I did it and it worked out.

It doesn't have to be a big dream! It can be exactly what you want right now. For the record I very much disliked vet school and live clinical practice.|Absolutely! I love it. ❤️ 

Wouldn't change to any other profession!|Nearly everyone in our class started in their mid-20s.

This is because we are doing them a kindness and relieving suffering. While I do cry during euths it's sympathy tears, I don't carry those with me through the day. Euthanasia is an essential service and probably most important aspect of my job. I actually like that we can relieve suffering this way in animal medicine. One of my many reasons for being a vet is to help suffering animal. Death is a part if life. If I can ease their passage I have done good. For this reason Euthanasias have never been hard on me. I never carry it as a burden. It's not meant to be seen as such IMO.

The hard part is when an animal is sick and owners don't want to do anything about it and let the suffering continue.|I'm 5 years out and still ask tons of questions! I learn so much everyday. I also make mistakes too. We're human. You just gotta keep learning and growing.

I devoted my precious extra time to brushing up on stuff I'll actually use once in practice.|For me, like many others, it's not actually the euthanasias that are the hardest. This is because we are doing them a kindness and relieving suffering. While I do cry during euths it's sympathy tears, I don't carry those with me through the day. Euthanasia is an essential service and probably most important aspect of my job. I actually like that we can relieve suffering this way in animal medicine. One of my many reasons for being a vet is to help suffering animal. Death is a part if life. If I can ease their passage I have done good. For this reason Euthanasias have never been hard on me. I never carry it as a burden. It's not meant to be seen as such IMO.

The hard part is when an animal is sick and owners don't want to do anything about it and let the suffering continue.|I'm 5 years out and still ask tons of questions! I learn so much everyday. I also make mistakes too. We're human. You just gotta keep learning and growing. 

Best thing is to learn how to close the book on work and not take it home with you. It can take practice but it's a skill worth learning. Work at work. Everything else is downtime.|I think I did like 3. 

I Havnt done any since. #ER|If it was so far along that it succumbed to the GDV in the time that OP described I don't think emergency interventions or surgery would have made a big difference. The prognosis was grave regardless what OP (or their team) did or didn't do.|Sedate me please!|34F here. Grad 2019. Had baby in 2022 at 32y. Canadian so I took my full 18mo leave, now back 3/4 time:

Have your baby.

Take ALL the time off you want. 

Come back part time if you want.

Ease back into it.

Vet med will always be there. Spending time with baby and being there for her is my priority now. Work is second. I love being a vet but it has changed my outlook. Life is so much more now. As the kids say ""it's totally extra"". I'm living my best life for me and my kid. She and family are priority and I love this mental shift. Before I was burnt out, so tired of work. I'm refreshed and have put way less pressure on myself. I'm having fun again, working less, and spending more time with her.

I don't know what you mean by ""advancing"" in your career. Unless you are wanting or planning on specialty taking a year (or more) off at this point isn't going to hurt you. You've got the skills, you've got the experience, you've got the credentials. Vets are in demand, you won't be any less valuable after you take time to have your baby.|Well, you can't be good at everything and practice takes time. I've been out 5 years and can't place an iv catheter to save anyone's life. You'll have your strengths and your weaknesses that's why we work as a team. I couldn't do it without my techs, they couldn't do it without me. We all help each other.

Oh and you'll have your good days and bad. Some days you'll miss every poke and that's just the way thar cookie crumbles.|Lol the techs have given me more than one 🫣🤦‍♀️ on many occasion when I try to ""help"" them with their tasks.",Other
Never in my life have a heard techs talk to a doctor like that. New grad or not. These must be bitter and jaded technicians to disrespect someone who has dedicated so many years of their life to make sure they have a field to work in.,Other
"New grad here too. Not quite sure about the west coast but I heard CA pays more than the east coast regions due to high taxes, and I was offered 120K-140K by different companies and these were like 30-1hr drive from the HCOL area east coast. My friends were offered 170-180K in NYC HCOL area. I feel like OC CA is extremely HCOL area so you should ask for more base salary. Also probs ask for more PTO and more CE?|yes, I am aware of that, but isn't there a contract/ offer letter signing?? 

Is there nothing like that? I was wondering when would you ""sign"" a legal document with them. 

Thanks!!|Yes, I do know that I will be penalized if I decline as I said above. However, just wanted to know the General timeline of what happens after the match! 

Situation changed from when I ranked and applied, and just after the withdrawal deadline, so I am struggling to figure out how I could deal with it.|March 4th isn’t it?|I will try my best not to, and hopefully I won’t have to, if I match. Thanks so much for giving me very through explanation! 
I do have an extenuating circumstance that involves my family financially, so might have to support them and with internship salary, I won’t be able to, but I really want to specialize. I wasn’t quite sure what to do, so I thought asking would be better.  Thanks so much for helping out!!|Thanks so much!!!|Thank you so much!

I heard it was 11 hrs with 1 day and 3 days 8 hrs, not quite sure how hard it is during the day. I might ask that question to the hospital staff! 

It is a compete, so great for me! 

I did hear that they do have great mentorship, but not so sure how they run it. 

I'll do some more research! thanks so much!!|Okay, got it!!! Thanks so much for explaining :)|Most corporates do!!!|Yeah, definitely heard all about and researched about corporates, since most of my school people are from the states. However, I need a working visa and green card to work in the states and I don’t think any non-corporates would sponsor those.|Thanks so much!!!",Other

"Not a vet but in reception at one where we’re so slow I’ve been dialed back to 25-27 hr/wk vs 33-38. We are expensive and won’t give ballpark pricing of basic procedures like spays/neuters. Most inquiries don’t book when they can’t get an answer. We have space for surgeries next week; when I was hired last June we were at least three weeks out.

Meanwhile, the clinic half a mile down the road that is well known for being inexpensive hasn’t taken new clients in over 7 years and we are getting clients from them because their spays/neuters are booked out until late fall. They are bleeding clients because they can’t keep up with demand with three vets to our one.

We charge $75+ for a feline leukemia vaccine that costs about $12. Is this normal? Our spays/neuters are on the high side. Can a practice’s pricing drive business down like this?|Yesterday we did a follow up exam after a dental referral to a specialist, plus two vaccines. $206.00. The woman about fell over. We saw the cat shortly prior to the referral so should the follow up be full price ($83)? Normally we discount the exam fee when vaccines are given but didn’t on this one for some reason. We are pricing ourselves out of business. 😞|That should be mitigated by explaining the extraneous conditions that could drive the price up. The next statement is “these will be determined upon exam.”  I would say a majority of the prospective clients who call asking for a ballpark and don’t get one end up elsewhere.|I agree with that on the whole but there are extraneous reasons I hesitate to. This is affecting my attitude, though. Since our tech throws out claims that every practice is this way, I just wanted to see how true that was.|Thank you|Well, at this point in time with my hours cut significantly because we are slow, I have noticed that a significant proportion of queries about general cost of spays and neuters fail to book an appointment.

Now there is rumor that the practice is considering adding a tech appointment fee on top of the cost of vaccines. We are charging about $75 for a feline leukemia vaccine as it is. I understand needing to generate income to support the practice but increasing costs in a slow environment seems like a shoot your own foot solution.|Thank you. It’s leaving a bad taste in my mouth. As a pet owner of multiple pets I have always had to be cost conscious but this practice acts as though if they have to ask then we don’t want them.

"Not a vet, just a lurker. This happened to my spouse’s field—psychology. 

There was a sudden proliferation of professional schools offering PsyD degrees to practically anyone willing to pay the $200k+ tuition. Prior to this, the vast majority of psychologists obtained PhD degrees and funded their education through grants or teaching. 

The PhD programs typically had class sizes of 4-10 people. The PsyD programs are packed to the brim (not sure on the exact numbers, maybe the modal PsyD program is around 50+ per class?)

As a result, the field is now overwhelmed by too many PsyD recipients who have worse training and higher debt burdens. This has driven down the reimbursement for psychology services nationwide. What used to be a straightforwardly lucrative field is now a lot trickier to navigate.",Other

"San Francisco, CA here! We added another doctor in October (to make 5 FT) and then were horribly slow through the rest of 2023 and into january. We noticed that the beginning and ends of the week would fill so Wednesday when all doctors were working, we were so slow across the board. So we spread doctor schedules out a bit more and trained our front desk to be more intentional about trying to schedule mid week. We are finally picking up. But honestly, i was speaking with the other doctors and despite being so bored some days, i’ve liked the change of pace to allow me more time per appointment and feel more inclined to really work things up. As has been mentioned in other comments, it has helped me slow down, develop my soft skills, spend more time researching weird labwork results, consult with other doctors, etc.

Hang in there!|salary depends a lot on location and specialty. Small animal ER vets generally make the most of everyone. I’m in the bay area, started making 125k as a new grad doing small animal GP.

Honestly, i find it all very manageable. I have no family money, i am not independently wealthy, I worked three part time jobs in undergrad and vet school, still graduated with no savings.

"Should I pursue a DVM if I struggle in math? Bit of a background. I have always had a delay in math. Throughout my HS,MS and ES years I have always struggled with math. In HS I barely passed with a 61 in Algebra and on Algebra 2 I did not pass and had to make up credits, I did okay in Geometry (79 and that was the highest grade I've ever gotten in math) and currently have a 77 in my Intro to College Alg class. I'm a senior in HS who goes to an Agricultural HS and I have taken veterinary classes and I LOVE it. I find it fascinating. In those classes we did a lot of care for the animals and that includes injections and the calculations/dilution ratio for those meds. But I am worried about not being able to go to vet school or pre-vet with how I struggle with complex equations and worried about passing Calculus/Statistics. I am doing a 2 year term at a community college then I plan to transfer to pre-vet then go to vet school. I CAN do it, its just hard for me. I am going to be tranfering my IEP to a 504 plan before I go to college. Do you think I should pursue Vet if I'm worried about not getting in due to math grades? Would Vet Schools be accepting to a person who has delays in math? I do have a tutor and I visit him 2-3x per week currently for help. My other grades are fine, I'm really good with everything else and I excell in Biology and other sciences. But this is the one thing that keeps on worrying me.",Other

It is decaying our society. Sorry you're going through this. I'm a student and don't have experience this problem but your options sound fine to me from an ethical perspective. People are just lashing out because you can call the procedure declawing.
This is where I think you need to be exceptionally careful in communicating with the owner when you make your initial recommendation especially depending on their target demographic, as people under 35 these days generally love to post their lives on SM and get feedback from the ether.|You'll me in massive debt in both fields, you'll just be more comfortable paying off your debt as an MD. It's entirely up to you|Yeah specialists are much more comfortable for sure and all the procedure/task oriented services can typically work as hard as they want in busy areas. GP pay is getting better but only in the context of rising housing costs and general inflation.

She probably wouldn't try to go and cut a foreign body out of her own animal, she would pay a vet to do it. If anything it's more of an approval-seeking behaviour to try and do something really basic like give a vaccine yourself that you aren't technically supposed to do, she's trying to come up to your level rather than the opposite.
Also, people will always value animals less on average than other people, so yes there will always be MDs who feel they understand animal medicine because they understand human medicine.|Cool and if that happened they would probably take their puppy to the vet ER, just like if their puppy were stung by a bee or suddenly developed angioedema. Yes they probably could technically start an IV and deliver a reasonable medication, the dose could be referenced quickly online in my country. Should they do that? Probably not. Do they have the equipment handy in their living room? Probably not. You act like just because it's an animal that human medics would be essentially reading a foreign language trying to do anything with their pet. You only do us a disservice by trying to dig trenches between us and the rest of medicine.|Yeah so it's also animal abuse for farmers to vaccinate their herds/flocks as well. We should demand that all farm animals be vaccinated by veterinarians only, because clearly vets are the only people competent to do so.
Also we should immediately stop all SQ fluids at home for renal cats, because owners can't possibly be trusted to administer SQ fluids by themselves. This is the grossest form of animal abuse, because you're giving maybe 20-30x the volume of a vaccine subcutaneously.|Yeah you're right so let's keep all pets for several hours of obs after we vaccinate, because we know animals never survive mass histamine release.|I was being facetious. Farmers by necessity have to inject the animals the own many many times in life.
I'd be interested to know what country you live in. That's not the case in north America nor in the UK as far as I know.|You're very entitled to your opinions. I actually work exceptionally well in teams and will be in this profession for a LONG time. Being senior doesn't mean you have all the answers. You failed to address my point that we vaccinate thousands of animals a day across multiple countries and then send them home immediately to have their anaphylactoid reactions. Do those animals not make it to the ER? Why don't we keep them in for obs overnight? How is the risk dramatically different vaccinating at home?
Also let me tell you it's a terrible thing to predict someone will kill themselves and you should know better.|There is still a relative shortage of veterinarians if not an absolute one. You can make arguments about pay but the fact is there aren't enough veterinarians applying for and accepting jobs for the number of clinics looking for vets. This is a shortage.
I would look at the combination of factors which the pandemic exacerbated, including pay, abuse, working hour expectations, mental health, etc. to understand why vets aren't staying in the profession.|Would you expect a newly graduated MD to be able to handle urethral obstruction, an RTA or an obese OHE? I think it's ridiculous to expect new grad vets be able to handle these problems effectively and to be able to make nuanced medical decisions. They should definitely understand the thinking behind management of these cases but I think youre being a bit reductionist in suggesting new grads are inadequate if they can't do these things.|Nobody expects a new grad to go out on day one and spay 20 adult, overweight dogs though. That's just not realistic. Being common doesn't mean something should be easy. We all know the adult spay is a very challenging procedure. We also all know that new grads start with cats and then do puppies before taking on bitches. I think you're just completely out of touch with reality here.

People who don't like science but just want to help animals are the people who tend to burn out of vet school because they can't keep up, or if they can it's unsustainable for four years.|Someone from Germany can comment but I'm fairly certain most Germans speak English better than Americans.

Good Samaritan laws only protect you if you're providing reasonable first aid (chest compressions, applying pressure, washing a wound). If you as a vet go around trying to intubate people at the scene of a crash and provide ALS level care, you're absolutely fucked and they won't protect you at all|tourniquets fall under good samaritan care especially with american gun violence. look at Stop The Bleed for advice if you want. in fact as a vet to be i'd recommend supporting your local community by taking the course, becoming an instructor and training laypeople in hemorrhage control|Having a DVM isn't why you're referred to as doctor in clinic. Your job is distinct from your degree. You're referred to as doctor because you're licensed to practice vet medicine.|Do you really want to reinforce the Dr name as much as possible?|The general public will never understand most degree titles without substantial exposure to academia somehow. Many don't even really understand how MDs are different from PhDs. This is why I harp on about how title clarity is very important, more so in human medicine where many allied health fields have doctoral professional degrees these days (pharmD, DPT, DNP etc). |See I disagree. Your title comes from the job you are employed in and your medical license, and has nothing to do with your degree. It's a very america-centric thing to suggest that you are a doctor because of your DVM. What about MVBs, BVMSs, BVetMeds? Are they not doctors then? The DVM that never licenses or practices. They are a DVM but would you like your clients and nurses asking them for advice or diagnoses or orders in your clinic during a visit just because they have a DVM degree?|Your doctoral degree gives you access to the title in daily life but PhDs generally dont go around referring to themselves as Dr xyz in hospitals or clinics, except for the super self-important, because in that context doctor is assumed to refer to physician, MD or in our case veterinarian. Yes, when you get the degree you are a ""doctor"", but you're not able to take on the job of ""doctor"" in clinic until you hold a medical license. You can't give nurses med orders, you can't legally make diagnoses, you can't discuss prognosis or counsel owners, etc until you have the appropriate license to do so. Thus the title Dr. and the degree DVM mean slightly different things. There are DVMs who don't hold medical licenses that actually shouldn't be called doctor in clinic for example, as that is confusing to others, as much as y'all think it's devaluing to the degree.|But you have a license somewhere, which means something. If that non-practicing unlicensed DVM walked into your clinic, would you want your techs/nurses asking them for medical orders? To make diagnoses?


Licenses are transferrable. Experience and practice with a medical license makes you a doctor. In a hospital, the job of doctor should be reserved for those who can guide owners/patients towards medical decisions. Job and title are not the same thing. Sure, PhDs call themselves doctor all they want in shops, pubs etc but not in hospitals and clinics.|MVB, BVMS and BVetMed are veterinary degrees from AVMA accredited UK vet colleges, none of them have doctor in the title and they are all specifically undergraduate or master's degrees. People will never ever understand academic degree titles and I don't think we should expect them to. Does it really matter whether or not they understand our specific training pathways as long as they understand the qualification? They also don't understand the difference between human nursing, medical, osteopathic medical, dental, optometric and podiatric degrees although all of those professions can diagnose, prescribe and/or perform surgery to some extent (nursing as nurse practitioners). It feels to me like the only reason to try to force people to understand the training pathway analogy is to soothe the ego. It doesn't take anything away from you or I as vets if Joe blow, owner of princess, thinks our degree was 2 years instead of 4. They can take the care or leave it until they educate themselves and figure out not to prejudge professionals.
Also I should point out that although it has doctor in the title, DVMs are undergraduate medical degrees. They are just second-entry undergraduate programs.|I think you're drinking the Kool aid a little bit here. DVMs are undergraduate level medicine courses even in the US. It has nothing to do with whether you've completed ""doctorate level coursework"" or not. It's got to do with whether you've qualified for a medical license by completing an AVMA accredited course. DVM is just a fancy flourish of letters to increase Americans sense of self-importance. It's an accomplishment to get one obviously, but it doesn't qualify you to practice the job of being a doctor. It qualifies you to get a license which allows you to practice the job of doctor.


Tbh my undergrad coursework was more rigorous and detailed than lots of my vet med course work.|this is an issue commonly discussed in human medicine but the principle applies here as well. do you think a nurse with a PhD in nursing should introduce themselves as Dr. xyz to patients? how about a pharmacist with a PharmD? DPT physiotherapist?

what about MVBs, or BVetMeds? do they not get to call themselves doctor? there's no doctor in their veterinary degree title. RVTs who also have a research doctorate? do they get to introduce themselves as Dr. soandso to owners?

your ability to fulfill a ROLE or JOB in a hospital is what makes you a doctor to the general public, not your degree title. youre conflating honorary titles of doctor in the social domain with the job of doctor in a hospital when they are separate things.

yes obviously licensure in one state does not automatically hold bearing in any other state. once you have obtained the general substrates for a license (a veterinary degree, NAVLE completion in north america) you can complete locally specific substrates and apply for licenses with ease. in that sense, having a license in one place makes you roughly eligible to apply for licensure in another, especially when other boards request letters of good standing etc.|You're allowed to hate it. I couldn't possibly take myself so seriously. I suppose if you're working hard people will always recognize that before what's embroidered on your coat.|Correct, that's my entire point. A doctor can be a social title or it can be a job but for some people it's not both. For vets and MDs we are called doctor in the hospital because of our medical license rather than our doctoral degree.
To be even more confusing, nurses can have research phds or DNPs which often qualify them as nurse practicioners.|Depends how hard you work in RVT school. I'd be willing to bet if a dedicated and focused student did a bachelor's program in vet technology, they could make their life a hell of a lot easier in vet school.|Your ability to do well in an MMI has very little to do with your ability to speak with clients.|If you think it's condescending to acknowledge someone's feelings the class is absolutely targeted specifically at you.|Who cares about how respected a degree is? If that's your rationale for getting one or the other and you hate the job in the end, you're going to have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars. You should get the degree that allows you to do the work you want to do because YOU respect it, not because other people do|Sounds like somebody didn't communicate the clinic membership well|Some people do three or four internships, but it would be uncommon for you to do only a rotating and get a position.

I'm not graduated and not interested in being a formal mentor but happy to chat if you need casual advice.|Social media is a cesspit of knee jerk emotional reactions and moral grandstanding. It is decaying our society. Sorry you're going through this. I'm a student and don't have experience this problem but your options sound fine to me from an ethical perspective. People are just lashing out because you can call the procedure declawing.
This is where I think you need to be exceptionally careful in communicating with the owner when you make your initial recommendation especially depending on their target demographic, as people under 35 these days generally love to post their lives on SM and get feedback from the ether.|You'll me in massive debt in both fields, you'll just be more comfortable paying off your debt as an MD. It's entirely up to you|Yeah specialists are much more comfortable for sure and all the procedure/task oriented services can typically work as hard as they want in busy areas. GP pay is getting better but only in the context of rising housing costs and general inflation. Unfortunately vet med by nature will be behind the curve of human med because we will simply never spend as much on animal medical care as humans. Also it's a pretty select few who can become DACVS haha|Why let other people's actions ruin an entire category of practice for you? You're the boss now, you can find a practice that suits you and be in control of how things happen.|Everybody says they can't see themselves doing anything else but I find it's often simply because they don't actually know what jobs look like. You're attracted to this funny, inaccurate but idealized imagination of what being a vet is, but you should go and get some work experience in various fields to help you decide.|There's so much more to the challenges of this profession but that's a start.|So your first reason for regretting being in vet med is something you have total control over? Get a new job if you don't get along with your coworkers.
Also letting people get under your skin gives them the greatest power over you. Get someone to help you manage difficult interactions. They literally don't have to ruin your day.|You sound salty. There is definitely a distinct advantage to having a solid knowledge base built on memorization of useful facts about medicine. Yes if you know how to problem solve and find information you can get there despite a weak knowledge base but having the memorization component gets you through the problem solving faster. Navle success obviously isn't the sole predictor of success as a vet but knowing things helps immensely instead of having to look them up constantly.|How else do you address a fundamental knowledge licensing exam to an entire profession with so many diverse end points? How else do you justify allowing vets to literally switch focuses at the drop of a hat? No, not every vet is going to be omniscient, but do you instead want to change licensing to be segregated by species? How do you ensure that vets have adequate training and knowledge to work with the species they about to operate on or prescribe meds to? I guarantee schools can't prepare us adequately and I do agree fundamentally that board licensing exams can be problematic, but there are some really questionable vets out there with licenses. What do you do instead?|specialization already exists. examples include surgery, anaesthesia, medicine, large animal medicine, oncology, opthalmology, general practice. we don't expect all vets to do all of these things expertly. i dont think you need to be omniscient or expert in all of these fields to pass the navle. you do have to have an understanding of vet med and be ready to enter any of these fields though.|I hope you don't talk to everybody in your life with so much derision. Obviously we aren't expected to be competent at everything after four years. Yes I agree that the standard of training in this profession is mediocre at times. I don't think it has to do with the navle|Grossed over 1mill as in you billed over 1mill for the practice?|Texas doesn't have an income tax does it?|I didn't become a vet because of a love of animals. Such an unfortunate cliche.|I think you should reflect on whether you actually feel hate for this person or whether it's something else that you're labelling as hate incorrectly. When we overuse the word hate to describe our feelings it probably makes us more negative. Better to stop and see if you're actually feeling resentment, insecurity, jealousy. Those are easier feelings to understand and move past than just hate.|You think vet med is far less important than software engineering? The science that much of our world today is built on? One of the most rapidly developing industries worldwide? I think you're confused.|typo, i meant to say far more important. my comment still stands. i think you vastly overestimate the importance of vets to your average individual. animal health care has always and will always take a back seat to many other things. if you wanted a ""fair"" salary as a ""doctor"" you should've gone to med school. having a doctoral degree means virtually nothing. people don't pay you millions of dollars just because your degree has the word doctor in it.|LOL you're funny|Then you must already understand that academic doctors don't have the same earning potential as medical doctors and it's essentially because of variability in demand for their distinct skill sets as well as the mechanisms through which procedural physicians bill for their services. Human health care is an inevitable expense so MDs will always have protected incomes. It's easy then to understand why vets will never be paid the same as human doctors, and if we were people would frankly just avoid seeking care for their animals|If you went into vet med just so people would have to call you doctor you chose the wrong profession. Vet med is a first entry degree in several countries, completed in 5-6 years of undergraduate work. Let's be honest, most people's undergrad was a four year lesson in how to study and be professional. Most people don't carry content forward from their undergrad which helps them practice medicine.|Vet med is absolutely doable if you are willing to develop your own interpersonal skills and resilience. There is definitely tons of abuse in the profession but if you can make it through whatever is thrown at you in vet school you start to set your own rules when you graduate. Once you're licensed you are absolutely in control and the field doesn't have to be a hell hole. It just tends to chew up people who don't develop their constitution on the way.|No unfortunately ethical teaching is mostly wasted on vets.|Because nobody actually follows the teaching, utilizes ethical frameworks, makes consistently balanced decisions, or acts in an ethical way. Tons of my classmates behave unethically all the time and they have it freshest in their minds. People just come to their knee jerk conclusion and defend why they consider their decision to be ethical. The righteous mind by Jonathan haidt provides some very good insight into this phenomenon.|a very gentle but incorrect attempt to analyze my perception. no, these are genuinely unethical decisions, its not a difference of ethical values. im fine with people having different personal ethics to me as long as there is no direct or indirect harm to others. my initial post was obviously hyperbole. many vets do ethical things. my criticism is that they often do it intuitively rather than rationally, and vet students can learn ethical frameworks but act hypocritically in spite of this, or fail to apply them to their own actions.|God that's horrific advice. I agree on sticking it out but definitely don't handle rotations like that|I'm struggling to remember anatomy and parasites as well, and I've been at the top of my class for three years.

I don't know why people fixate so much on animal slaughter when most of it is aimed to be done humanely.

If we're going to use animals for food the absolute least we can do is provide them with solid quality of life while we have them alive.|Organic food is a marketing scam to begin with and yeah I'll bet it has serious welfare implications. I've not spent time on an organic farm and I probably won't ever as I don't intend to practice on farm animals but it's not surprising at all.|Best to pick a school that is avma accredited and teaches in your first language. Also be aware that UK schools and some other vet programs in English speaking countries do not award DVMs, but an equivalent typically at the bachelor's level.

I got rejected from OVC three cycles in a row, now I just don't feel motivated to return after having to go internationally for my education. Ontario would have to pay me the difference in my tuition for me to return home at this point. Instead OVC has created 20 rural seats with Lakehead for students to try and lie their way into just to get admitted.|Nobody posting on Reddit asking about international vet schools can get into Canadian schools.|You need to apply for AVMA accredited schools to write the navle and work in Canada. Eaeve accreditation doesnt qualify you for a Canadian license as far as I know, without doing lots of additional, expensive licensing exams|OVC won't even interview students with less than a 90% average these days, despite their grade cutoff being 75%. The admissions process is a black box and we have no way to get help with improving our odds of admission, the school refuses to discuss these things. Students also seem to have a distinct advantage having gone to Guelph so in my experience if you went to any other university the odds were stacked against you.|Yep, I'm just saying the federal and provincial loans are not even close to enough to be able to pay tuition let alone afford the education. You essentially need to have wealthy parents to attend international vet school.|this is absolutely true, i know many of them from my vet program, but they are typically not canadians. the reality is that most canadian vet med applicants know of nothing outside of their provincial program. they all try really hard to get in and some don't even learn about international schools until their first or second rejection. the only students going to these international schools right away without a thought are the ones with independently wealthy parents with connections. most students who end up going internationally have tried in province several times already and are only going as a last resort.|OVC may not specifically select for guelph students but there is a guelph advantage in being in close proximity to the FVC, getting advice from vet student friends, having easy access to the limited feedback the school offers. i applied for years to OVC, got rejected with no explanation every year. strong candidate on paper, fantastic references from vets, human medical professionals, so much support from all of my colleagues, extracurriculars and strong work experiences. ill never know what they wanted me to say or not say, or what i got rejected for. all i know is i wasted three years of my life waiting for that school when i could be in internships right now. i am nothing special, and there are many extremely competent students in the exact same position that i was in, some of them are my classmates now.|No it won't as long as the school is AVMA accredited and you satisfy the other qualities and qualifications these programs are looking for. Just for your info if you're planning to attend school in the UK and it's even within the realm of possibility that you might want to pursue training here, UK internships won't even generally consider vets without 1-2+ years of GP experience.|Pay in the UK is extremely poor for new grads compared to Canada and the US.

It's not the only determining factor but vets that have a broader knowledge base definitely have the potential to be better vets|Correct, read my other post. There is still a correlation, because you have to know things to be a vet at all and really good vets know a lot of things. Obviously there are outliers when it comes to test performance but you can't say there's NO correlation, just that it's not a perfect correlation.|Yeah the system is definitely broken.

One of them mentioned the other day that they would have definitely preferred the shorter route. Can you provide any insight into that decision in your experience? Aside from not feeling like I belong here, I am also worried about committing another 6 years to schooling when I'm already 31.|Thank you! May I ask what you ended up doing with your degrees? And how you found mentors?|The biggest upside would be not taking up another 2 years of debt. If I left at this point, I could eventually pay it off with my back-up career. 😅|Thank you so much for sharing!! It feels better to know I'm not actually alone in the vet med world, and that someone has already made it out the other end. I am having a difficult time finding mentors (and externships that are not specifically for third/fourth year students) and would appreciate any insight? I applied to a couple externships for the summer but haven't heard back yet. I do work at the wildlife lab (research and necropsies!) - I love the work, I love my coworkers, and I am so in awe of my boss and her career but she is retiring and working remotely at this point. The wildlife pathologist who led me to vet school is having some health troubles and understandably doesn't have the time or energy for me. I feel like a lot of my anxieties are due to bad luck or bad timing.|Thank you for your insight! I love the pathologists at my school! I did apply for a diagnostic pathology fellowship for this summer but haven't heard back yet. I had some discouraging words from one of the pathologists the other day though, that I should have been showing that I was more interested in pathology somehow, or should already have a pathology case study published, should be visiting path programs at other schools, should have been working as a timeslip at the diagnostic lab, etc. It made me feel like I was already behind and it would be a very steep uphill climb to get into a residency at this point.|Thank you for sharing! You should know there are surprisingly a lot of equine students in my class! But it definitely helps me feel better to know it's not just me. 🙂|Tufts was one of my dream schools! I applied to their DVM/MPH program, but didn't get in. I will reach out to them for sure! Thank you.|I worked at an exotics-only vet for a couple years before vet school, and I work in the wildlife research lab now. I definitely want more experience with wildlife, but I think clinical exotics would be too much for me. I am not sure I'd like to be dealing with exotics clients every day for the rest of my life. 😅|Thank you. I did apply for some dual programs but wasn't accepted. I paraphrased the criticism (but those exact words were used). But I think his biggest points were that I don't have an exact plan of where I see myself in 10 years, I'm not searching out enough opportunities (""why don't you have a fellowship with the CDC already?""), and that I will hate vet med because I don't want to be a SA clinician (that was my bad for mentioning I would consider doing SA GP/ER/relief work for a couple years to pay off my loans).|Thank you! Yes, his point was that I don't have any clear goals with a 10-year plan. I have been having a difficult time finding mentors because of my interests, though I think it's mostly bad luck. One of my favorite pathologists is out for health reasons, the only wildlife vet on campus is retiring, and a couple of the other pathologists I've spoken with are not very supportive. I'm not sure how else to find mentorship?",Other

Thank you to all the responses ya'll have been really helpful. Id like to add that my main passion zoo veterinary and that is my end goal. I do hope to work full time at a zoo but my parents want me to have a private practice and be my own boss to earn more. Personally if i cant work with zoo and wildlife animals then Id rather not have my own clinic even if the salary is better.|I have always had a connection with wildlife and my main goal has always been in wildlife conservation. From my experience zoos are the best way to be directly involved in the health of wildlife. Although I have done a lot of research I am always willing to learn more.

"That is horrific! As a newer tech myself (licensed at the beginning of 2023), I have dealt with similar techs. They don’t even trust other techs.

Any sign of lack of confidence/weakness they strike. It’s part of why this field is so toxic and bad for mental health.

Would it be possible for you to respectfully stand up for yourself? For example, when the tech mentioned you might be good at Sx one day but for now you are not touching their animals, saying something like, “I understand your concern, but that comment was unnecessary. I did not offer or even suggest I do the Sx, so I would appreciate if you would keep your opinion of my abilities to yourself and allow the senior veterinarians to be the ones to assist me with my improvement.” Or when they made the ‘no offense but you’re not good with any sick animal’, responding “despite you saying no offense, that was offensive and I would appreciate it going foreword that you would reframe from such comments. You are not the one reviewing my performance or guiding me to being a better vet, so your negative comments are unwarranted and unnecessary.” (*honestly that might be more snippy than necessary, but you get my point.)

A lot of people are bitter in this field, make sure that it doesn’t dull your sparkle. We need the good kind vets who will support future baby vets and techs.|There is something to be said for confidence and reasonable caution. I also double check my work, I found others mistakes and my own frequently, and for certain things I have others check my work. I was told I was slow, but little to no errors were made. After a lot of criticism and jabs to my confidence, I tried to go faster. I made more mistakes and didn’t catch them until after the fact. All reversible, and avoidable if I would been allowed to double check myself or ask for assistance.

I find if you don’t meet the cocky confidence, making fun/hating on owners, hating/being aggressive with difficult patrons, life-sucks mentality; you are rejected, bullied, made to be miserable.

"The matching shirts at IVECCS was such an ick moment for me. It didn't feel professionals at a conference, it felt like they were using their employees to advertise their brand. They all seemed happy enough, but I'm not into that vibe.|Anecdotal experience aside, why do you find yourself holding on to Metro? Is it because you worry about the health of the pet, or the flack from a client if you don't prescribe it or because, gasp, the diarrhea is still happening after day 2? Something else? I'll point out that you didn't really come prepared to argue your stance FOR metro in your meeting, moreso you just brought evidence to shift the spotlight onto others. Certainly Prazosin is something that should be avoided, so your evidence is not wrong, but avoiding talking about your choices doesn't necessarily help in your decision making.

I've found I rarely have a reason to prescribe it anymore, and personally had a very easy time moving away from it. Sure, those really sick AHDS dogs I hospitalized at my ER could be a reason, but the watery to soft brown diarrhea with negative giardia/fecal dogs who are otherwise well, or the known dietary indiscretion cases, definitely don't need it. Nothing about an antibiotic is going to fix a dog who ate a dead bird faster than time, and maybe some extra fiber.

It's really good you're doing self reflection like this. You're not a dinosaur, you're just trying your best to find reasoning for how to make your medical decisions.

Also agreed, Gabapentin really grinds my gears and I wish we had more options for dogs.|Cats at least have Buprenorphine as a non-NSAID method of efficacious pain control to be sent home with. Dogs who can't have an nsaids or galliprant are stuck with Gabapentin or Tylenol, of which neither are proven to be significantly helpful|Do they, though? We have no science to tell us Metro is what they need to fix hematochezia except in cases of ""infection"", which we never really have evidence of. We can counter with anecdotes all day - in my experience it's pets who have been on only a couple days of treatment, so they need more time anyway, and the hematochezia comes and goes in about 48 hours regardless of what we give them, typically just a result of colitis. Certainly the ones who are still eating/drinking/not vomiting I don't dispense it right off the bat. The super sick ones who are hospitalized, sure I'll consider it, but even then I'm sure if that's what's doing the fixing. I hope they continue to dog deeper into the research so help shed light on these types of cases!|I suppose what I mean is the inconsistency at which these drugs are used, or even stocked at many clinics. At my ER, my biggest gripe is the post-op FBs with pissed guts who aren't in a place yet to have NSIADs (diarrhea ongoing and what not) - they have Nocita on board when we have it in stock, but we inconsistently use Gaba vs T+C as their oral pain med between doctors, and you're right T+C is at least better, but many doctors reach for the Gaba because its more familiar to them despite the studies. Old dogs with elevated liver enzymes and acute on chronic pain can be a bit of a headache in a similar way. This extends to the primary clinics we work with - many are very small and literally only have Carprofen/Galliprant and Gabapentin in stock for dogs, most at least have oral bup or Zorbium to dispense to cats, so when a dog can't get an nsaid with them, they get the leas effective regular Tylenol or Gabapentin.

I didn't mean to sound like it was some sort of dramatic rate limiting factor in practice, most cases it all works out fine, but Gabapentin is becoming the next tramadol in that some clinics  reach for it readily or only have that as another option because its cheap, easy, and has minimal side effects, without regard to trying to have other options available knowing its pain control effects are ""good enough"" to them anecdotally.

Hope that vent makes sense, lol.|Long since discovered to be not efficacious for pain. We do not even stock it at our clinic anymore|Ah, I see. You're lucky! It's an every day occurrence at my place. Owners of day 1 diarrhea pets will stroll through the door without a second thought even when we tell them it's not an emergency...womp womp|Davis is arguably the hardest US school to get into - they are the top vet school and primarily fill their seats with instate students, so there is a ton of competition in the thousands of out of state applicants for the few seats they do have for out of state. If applying to US schools is an option, are there others she could consider?",Other
"The next sentence expanded on the subject.|A young vet I know is active on Instagram and daily she post photos of clients pets in various stages of anesthesia recovery from a procedure, often shows the stitches. None of these photos are on the clinic’s social media sites. She’s going to be in a world of hurt if a sensitive client ever sees Bootsie’s photos used without permission.|At clinics where I worked we happily gave out spay/neuter/castration estimates over the phone with the caveat that if they find something on the pre surgical exam the fee could up- a need for a radiograph, lab, etc. 

I wouldn’t use a practice that required an exam to get the fee quote.|The difference in fees is wild. My solo practice vet charged a low exam fee because she didn’t want an exam fee to be a barrier to clients pets who needed to be seen. All meds, labs were 100+ mark up, radiographs were $90 a view. 

She moved away and my new solo practice vet charges a an exam fee $20 more than previous vet but meds are sold at about $5 more than ordering from a well known public vendor. 

The new vet ends up costing less because the meds aren’t marked up so high. 

One practice in the high money area requires full blood panel and chest X-rays for all spay/neuters, regardless of the pets age. That’s a $250 fee before the pet is sedated for spay/neuter. I’ve scrubbed in for so many cat neuters and it’s astonishing that some is going to spend $350 for a cat neuter.|That is 100% correct. The odds of a young animal, healthy on physical exam, being one of those that dies is slim. 

And yes, non profits perform a valuable, affordable service in reducing reproduction in pets. So do GP clinics that don’t require those test.|It’s an observation from working in a clinic that did not require them and taking phone calls at the clinic from people who were quoted $300 to neuter a 6 month old kitten.|Your vet will do a thorough palpitation of your pet feeling for abnormalities. Examine the eyes, ears. Listen to the heart/lungs and have you tell them what preventative products you use- heartworm, flea/tick- and what if any other meds the pet is on. Your pet will have been weighed and if it’s fat or trending towards fat then the pets diet & exercise will be discussed.|In human medicine patients now have 24/7 access to labs, summary of visit, etc done by their doctor. I’m not sure why a veterinarian would charge to reissue vax certificate. At best make a clear policy that the first one is included with the visit, additional copies cost X amount.|It may be your location- 45 minutes outside a major metro area can turn into a very rural area where youngish vets may not be interested in living.|Texas is a wonderful state and each region has its own identity: East verses west Texas, the Hill Country, Panhandle. A daughter lives in San Antonio and it’s wonderful for such a large city with plenty of things to do or just chill out by a pool. Austin & Dallas/Fort Worth traffic can be a hassle to navigate. Houston is a refinery city. 

I think if you lived 45 minutes outside any of those metro areas you would be pleased- big city offerings just a short drive away but day to day life in a smaller city.|As a woman just out of reproductive age, I hope Texas corrects the current flaw with the law. No one should experience what Kate Cox went through. 

And it would be great if the President would stop the illegal crossings in Texas at the border.|Illegal immigrants are an issue nationwide. Not legal immigrants.|Have the babies!! The vet work will always be there in the future.|I wonder about how her work day is managed? Is she double booked? Is no time for working on patient records built into her day or does staff not respect that time and interrupt her? Does she keep her scheduled appointments moving along?

Cornerstone is a good product if she selects to enter her records into it.",Other
"The technicians are being assholes to you. Everyone is new at some point in their career. I would speak with the managing director or hospital manager. Their bullying, condescending comments need to be stopped. That being said you should start looking for a kinder hospital setting while you are gaining your experience.

"The way that I feel like we have to confirm names and stuff but in real life I think I’ve rarely called and ask a client their name or how they would prefer to be called 😭 and these classes seem so pointless especially if you’ve worked up front like as a CSR, there are times I find them helpful but in most cases the way they talk is nowhere NEAR realistic. I much more enjoy client simulated encounters where I actually feel like I’m talking to clients and finding my own groove|I don’t support the private schools but I will say the public schools should be supported OR there should be more sponsored seats for students from states that don’t have schools to go to other programs. The problem with that is that vet schools with teaching hospitals are already struggling to teach the students they have from what I hear. Also I think there’s a lot to consider too- students from these states opening new schools might have to be choosing to either take a chance on a school that is new/doesn’t have a teaching hospital or take on an extra 80k of debt just to go to get the same degree from another school that is considered “superior” because it has a teaching hospital? I think that is a bit of a difficult thing to navigate because also that’s so much money. For the private schools this isn’t really an issue but there are many new state sponsored schools opening and these will allow students to pay in state tuition and reducing their debt|University of Arizona is a three year program and so while the year seems just as expensive it is still comparable to other public universities per semester, and has less interest accruing because it’s three years as well just fyi- it is also in state vs out of state and oos can qualify for IS after a year. It is also public like Texas Tech and has state funding|Which is luckily not quite accurate! That’s factoring living costs which are budgeted way higher depending on what you do lifestyle wise. For example, they budgeted around 1,600 a month or so for just rent- which is much less than I pay splitting with a roommate and others live in lower cost apartments. That’s why looking at JUST tuition it is comparable to other schools. Not to say that I support not having a teaching hospital, I wish we did, and I don’t know why I have to pay an equal amount of tuition my clinical year to literally be at other places- however I’m still saving a significant amount of money- at least 80k- as an AZ resident because of this school which will overall lower my debt and allow me to have less financial pressure and stress when I graduate. My living costs combined with scholarships that I received mean that my cost is actually much lower, and many of my classmates have at least some form of financial aid. I’m looking at closer to 150k versus going OOS where my next cheapest option has me at about 230k. Of course if you take out full COA then you’re looking at something more pricey, but again living costs aren’t actually as high as they estimated which is why I’m focusing on tuition!|Definitely understand that! I think from what I’ve heard there are many different sides to the education for clinical year. I’ve heard stories from students at places with teaching hospitals who describe their clinical year as being treated as a glorified tech for free labor getting to do barely any procedures because of competition with interns and residents. 

On the other hand, I’ve talked to students from my school who during their clinical year have wracked up hundreds of surgeries under their belt, from spays and neuters to dentals, amputations, enunciations, etc… and basically running appointments by themselves, but I’ve also heard students who said they went to rotations where they didn’t get to do much or saw some not as good standard medicine. I think that the variability is probably much crazier and depends on how you plan your clinical year and what site you go to.

So I definitely see the concern and I think both have pros and cons to them!

And it seems like looking at tuition then it’s pretty comparable. I was accepted to Cornell OOS and chose to go to U of A as a resident and when I compared costs it was over 100k more. Not to mention, a three year program means that interest accrues slightly less because you graduate sooner which is a trade off with not having summer breaks . 

Sorry this is so long lol|That’s great! I think the issue is there is a big bias that a teaching hospital is gold standard and that’s the way it’s been for so long, which I do think has lots of benefits but also there’s a lot of cons with it as well. I also hate that our program is getting a bad rep, I’m hoping that as more grads go out and hopefully make a good impression and we hopefully do better on NAVLE it will fix the stigma.

I much more enjoy client simulated encounters where I actually feel like I’m talking to clients and finding my own groove|I don’t support the private schools but I will say the public schools should be supported OR there should be more sponsored seats for students from states that don’t have schools to go to other programs. The problem with that is that vet schools with teaching hospitals are already struggling to teach the students they have from what I hear. Also I think there’s a lot to consider too- students from these states opening new schools might have to be choosing to either take a chance on a school that is new/doesn’t have a teaching hospital or take on an extra 80k of debt just to go to get the same degree from another school that is considered “superior” because it has a teaching hospital? I think that is a bit of a difficult thing to navigate because also that’s so much money. For the private schools this isn’t really an issue but there are many new state sponsored schools opening and these will allow students to pay in state tuition and reducing their debt|University of Arizona is a three year program and so while the year seems just as expensive it is still comparable to other public universities per semester, and has less interest accruing because it’s three years as well just fyi- it is also in state vs out of state and oos can qualify for IS after a year. It is also public like Texas Tech and has state funding|Which is luckily not quite accurate! That’s factoring living costs which are budgeted way higher depending on what you do lifestyle wise. For example, they budgeted around 1,600 a month or so for just rent- which is much less than I pay splitting with a roommate and others live in lower cost apartments. That’s why looking at JUST tuition it is comparable to other schools. Not to say that I support not having a teaching hospital, I wish we did, and I don’t know why I have to pay an equal amount of tuition my clinical year to literally be at other places- however I’m still saving a significant amount of money- at least 80k- as an AZ resident because of this school which will overall lower my debt and allow me to have less financial pressure and stress when I graduate. My living costs combined with scholarships that I received mean that my cost is actually much lower, and many of my classmates have at least some form of financial aid. I’m looking at closer to 150k versus going OOS where my next cheapest option has me at about 230k. Of course if you take out full COA then you’re looking at something more pricey, but again living costs aren’t actually as high as they estimated which is why I’m focusing on tuition!|Definitely understand that! I think from what I’ve heard there are many different sides to the education for clinical year. I’ve heard stories from students at places with teaching hospitals who describe their clinical year as being treated as a glorified tech for free labor getting to do barely any procedures because of competition with interns and residents. 

On the other hand, I’ve talked to students from my school who during their clinical year have wracked up hundreds of surgeries under their belt, from spays and neuters to dentals, amputations, enunciations, etc… and basically running appointments by themselves, but I’ve also heard students who said they went to rotations where they didn’t get to do much or saw some not as good standard medicine. I think that the variability is probably much crazier and depends on how you plan your clinical year and what site you go to.

So I definitely see the concern and I think both have pros and cons to them!

And it seems like looking at tuition then it’s pretty comparable. I was accepted to Cornell OOS and chose to go to U of A as a resident and when I compared costs it was over 100k more. Not to mention, a three year program means that interest accrues slightly less because you graduate sooner which is a trade off with not having summer breaks . 

Sorry this is so long lol|That’s great! I think the issue is there is a big bias that a teaching hospital is gold standard and that’s the way it’s been for so long, which I do think has lots of benefits but also there’s a lot of cons with it as well. I also hate that our program is getting a bad rep, I’m hoping that as more grads go out and hopefully make a good impression and we hopefully do better on NAVLE it will fix the stigma. I think there needs to be more PUBLIC vet schools to help support students from those states and give them better chances of becoming a vet with less debt, also hopefully putting vets in those higher need areas because they can with a lower debt load|Also lowkey can I shoot you a pm to ask you some questions about your clinical year 👁️👁️|Echoing the above! I had the same thoughts right before I entered vet school (except for wildlife biology) and it’s pretty similar as far as job prospects and internships go.

"Their treatment towards you in uncalled for, but as an LVT of nearly a decade, I understand not wanting a new grad touching my animal. Don't get me wrong, they could be more delicate. Here is my reasoning:

Those who get accepted into vet school have good book smarts, but the applicable veterinary skills are often no more than kennel attendant and grooming. I have done A LOT of work with 4th year residents coming through my HQHVSN clinic, and they have no technical skills. Can't restrain, can't draw blood, can't place a catheter, can't do much of anything. Sure, that's why you have techs, but you should be able to perform these tasks should you be short. 45min for a routine spay is good starting out, but too long overall, granted I work with doctors who do 100lb spays in 15min, and cat spays in 2min. Basically, we see new grad DVMs as babies- sponges of book knowledge but no ability to put it to use. Again, their treatment towards you is messed up, but the reasoning is there.",Other

All the things people say about low pay and lack of quality training are true, but there are other factors that have contributed to and will continue to contribute to the shortage. For one, boomers have held onto every position in every field far too long. Many of them are finally retiring, opening up positions. Also, it’s something that no one wants to talk about in fear of being labeled a sexist is the fact that vet schools are now 80/20 (or more) female to male. Every profession that’s overwhelmingly female has shortages. Many women prioritize having and raising children (understandable) over career.

This was a long time ago like close to 20 years ago bur I knew someone who had been on a farm like grew up on one or what have you (I grew up in a small town and probably half of my classmates lived in rural country areas possibly on farms) his daughter wanted a puppy and he decided to fix the dog like a sheep! I think he bought all the supplies from a farm store. Then the dog started chewing the area so he (maybe asked for medical advice at that point) and he put a cone around the dog’s neck. Low and  behold his daughter couldn’t keep up with the puppy and they gave him away and the people who took him just assumed he was vaccinated because he was “fixed.” I wonder if they lived within city limits and tried to get him a dog license. If they lived outside of city limits a lot of people in the rural area I grew up in don’t bother to seek veterinary care for “farm animals” unless the animal gets sick although dogs are more likely cared for than cats or other animals. If a dog lived in the town I lived in it was hard to hide the fact you had an animal and avoid licensing your dog but out of town not so much.,Other

"To my knowledge, this actually happens all the time with primates due to them being so close to humans, especially for any surgical need. Likely there was an entire veterinary team also present and participating in the treatment and care. So more of a professional collaboration over this human-like animal that bridges that gap. Also I’m pretty sure as long as there is a veterinarian around, in certain facilities like zoos and research hospitals, human doctors can do surgery. I know that in places like a human research hospital that use mice and rats, often it’s PhDs and grad students who do smaller procedures on the animals in their research and MDs doing the more challenging procedures.

"Uhhhh, that mention does nothing but reinforce the weak potential of this coin.

I like the project and dev team, but it's pretty disappointing to see all chatter stop and to get nothing from the dev team at all since the ico finished and they cashed up.

$8 would be good. Have to wait and see. 

I'm just an idiot who bought the hype. 
Picked mine up at the wrong time. So I'm in a holding pattern until the situation bottoms or improves. 

No choice but to remain optimistic. One thing I don't have is weak hands. I bought in prepared to see it through for better or worse and that's what I'm doing.

"Vet tech and practice manager here: actually go to the hospital with a resume in hand!!  If you don’t know how to write up a resume get online and learn!!  It should be 2 pages or less since you have no previous vet experience.  My motto is “if you’re too lazy to pound the pavement you’re too lazy to work in vet medicine”.  I realize I’m old and times have changed but if you are able to go out and visit the hospitals do so!!  You might see something in person that makes you realize that particular clinic is not a fit for you.  
I never reply to someone just inquiring over the phone, that shows no initiative.  At the least, send a nice email with your resume attached. Once the resume is submitted call or stop in within 2 weeks as a follow up. 
Research the hospitals, if they have a ton of turnover that’s a red flag. 
Best of luck to you!!",Other

"While we didn't get as many wildlife lectures as companion animals, livestock, or equine, my school did include them and we had wildlife rotations in our clinical year where the students were very hands on. This likely varies from school to school but there are many that have strong wildlife programs. I agree that undergrad +/- a master's in wildlife programs would be beneficial, not only in getting a solid knowledge base in wildlife, but also in building relationships with people who may have connections at those schools which would help when applying.",Other
"Why do you want to be a zoo vet? Do you know what it entails? The mandatory internships and residencies that are required? The type of life you’ll have?

"You are describing possible outcomes, but not likely ones.  
Even in the extremely unlikely event that authorities contacted you about traffic at your IP, you do have your node interface, including connectivity logs,  and huge amounts of proof that you are running a VPN node.  
In the same way as somebody driving above the speed limit, it is possible you will be caught and it does happen, but 99.99% of the time it doesn’t.  
For me personally, 99% of the time I’m not even in the same part of the country as my node, so can prove I wasn’t present when an activity occurred.

In fact the key thing is the whole point. i.e. you can prove that you didn't perform the activity, but you can't tell them who did. Nobody can. That's the whole point. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mm3en/ | You are correct, but you will fail your responsibility as you can prove you weren't the user, but have no way of finding out who did. And you can prove it is impossible to know.

Same as Tor nodes or any ""theoretically"" non logging VPN service. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mn4id/ | Before that failure, however, let’s go back a few steps.

When you are questioned about “suspicious activity” on your IP address, you would of course ask how the authorities know about this.

They would explain that they have been “monitoring” your IP. You would ask to see the warrant giving them permission to wiretap. They probably won’t have one, in which case you can now pursue them for illegal interception.

If they do, then you can ask to see the court transcripts for the application. If it doesn’t precede the date of the offence, then they have obtained a warrant illegally and you should sue them.

If it does, then you can ask to see the evidence upon which this wiretap was obtained. If it doesn’t exist, which it won’t, then you can sue them for obtaining a wiretap based on no evidence.

If they do have evidence that proceeds the wiretap authority, then you are a criminal and should be imprisoned.

What we all know, of course, is that the government, still monitors all traffic illegally (since Snowden), they can at no time admit this and so will never pursue minor infractions or pursue anybody that forces them down a path where they have to admit illegal activity.

Also, since Snowden, almost all traffic passing through the Internet is secured. Most is secured at the traffic level, meaning that it is still possible to use meta data to infer illegal content. However much of the Internet is adopting TLS (Transport Layer Security) meaning no traffic is able to be decrypted, meaning no analysis is possible (either Meta or otherwise).

In all but one scenario above, what we are describing is illegal activity being actioned by authority organisations that we pay and employ. In this case, the authorities themselves should be taken to court and those responsible should be imprisoned. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mrgps/ | I think that is the same for most countries. But they still have to prove it is you. Two things to remember, the officer you are dealing with is just doing his job and wants it to be as easy as possible, secondly authorities assume you are afraid or lazy also.

Think of the client (your customers) experience. 

As a service provider, say your node was very close to it's daily limit. You then have a client connect. After a few MB of data, suddenly either no traffic flows, or they get disconnected. That wouldn't be a good experience for them. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10jnw50/limit_data_usage_per_day_possible/j5o8mm8/",Other

"$75,000|In New Zealand that is good pay.
Just 2 years ago we used to be on average $58,000 salary for new grads... So we're happy with how things are at the moment.|I'm not sure if this comment will be seen, but as a recent grad myself (1+ years now), I've found myself quite anxious for the first couple of months (the fear of potentially misdiagnosing/ mucking up surgery) - and it will happen. Not just due to poor knowledge/ execution of a consult but because owners are limited on how much they can cover for diagnostics.

However, there are a couple of things that I have learned that come in handy with every consult.

1. Do not be shy to send for referral/ samples to labs - They will often send you clinical notes about the referral case so that you can learn for next time when presented with a similar case.

2. Familiarise yourself with the drugs you have at the clinic - (you don't have to memorise every drug in your university notes!)

3. Join a clinic that is willing to help - there will be a few hiccups but staff/ clients are often understanding of new grads and the anxiety we feel

4. Go over previous consults on your system that other vets have done at the clinic - this is crucial to get a handle on how things run at the clinic.

5. Go over notes on common cases such as vaccines, skin consults and gastro cases and there will always be a vet you can ask for help.

6. Get Balckwells 5 minute consults/ VIN - Both are awesome sources

7. Enjoy it! Think of all the effort you've put in to get here. For me working is completely different from just relaying information from uni. Keep things simple and keep NSAIDs and Antibiotics by your side as they are epic drugs :)",Veterinarian

Care with places that advertise as salary package (includes super). In my experience they seem to be less likely to pay well and have an unhealthy perspective on what a decent offer is for an employee.

I suggest accepting the fact you will need to move jobs a few times, progressively achieving pay rises each time. This is when you have the most leverage. 

Get memberships, they absolutely translate to better pay, particularly in high quality clinics. The clinics that don't value memberships, generally don't represent the cream of the industry anyway. Surgery is a great membership, imaging is another, GP memberships are decent (talking smallies here). Medicine is good as well but doesn't have the same revenue generation opportunity. That being said, you should study what your find i testing, otherwise you will be miserable during the preparation. 

The willingness to do surgery is a massive bonus, it's amazing how many new/recent grads either can't do it/are terrified to perform it. I'm talking speys/castrates/lumpectomy/dental. Nothing crazy really. 

If you are aren't tied down by financial responsibility (kids). You can work here for a year or so to find your feet, then travel around Aus locuming. You can often get accomodations for coastal rural placements, good pay and see some beautiful country. .

- Kookaburra Vets
- Vetlink

Vetlink is better suited to finding you a clinic that may suit your needs/what your looking for. There is more of a 'match the right clinic for the right person view. That being said, vetlink charges a massive fee to the employer, which may reduce the pay they offer. So that's to say, Kookaburra Vets may be more hit and miss and up to you to find a good fit but the pay opportunities will likely be higher. 

Some jobs describe their pay rates online, that may give you a guide. Note, the top pay is for people with 10 years experience and/or leadership experience/positions and/or memberships.

The willingness to do surgery is a massive bonus, it's amazing how many new/recent grads either can't do it/are terrified to perform it. I'm talking speys/castrates/lumpectomy/dental. Nothing crazy really. 

If you are aren't tied down by financial responsibility (kids). You can work here for a year or so to find your feet, then travel around Aus locuming. You can often get accomodations for coastal rural placements, good pay and see some beautiful country. .

- Kookaburra Vets
- Vetlink

Vetlink is better suited to finding you a clinic that may suit your needs/what your looking for. There is more of a 'match the right clinic for the right person view. That being said, vetlink charges a massive fee to the employer, which may reduce the pay they offer. So that's to say, Kookaburra Vets may be more hit and miss and up to you to find a good fit but the pay opportunities will likely be higher. 

Some jobs describe their pay rates online, that may give you a guide. Note, the top pay is for people with 10 years experience and/or leadership experience/positions and/or memberships. 


Good luck and welcome aboard!|You don't necessarily hate being a vet, you hate being a vet at that clinic. 

I know you have to say everything that needs to be said, but I think you know you have to try other clinics before you give up.

Don't project clinic based issues onto the career as a whole. You will become unfairly disenfranchised.|Consider North America as well, if you want to earn a lot more money and get some savings behind you.

I'm from Aus as well, the NAVLE wasn't hard.|No I never ended up going. I have 2 friends who did and they loved it. Both went to Canada and then 1 of them moved to the US for a bit. 

The money is WAY higher than in Australia. You could easily pay off your HECS and save up for a little travel. 

The downside is that the work-life balance in the US is pretty bad. At least that seems to be the typical story. Canada will pay a bit less than the US but work life balance seems better. 

Both of my mates came back eventually to be closer to home. They both came back with much more money saved than I had managed to save, helped them get a house and pay off HECS. 

They got to snowboard in Canada, see the national parks, camp in the wilderness and meet new friends. 

The cold was a big issue for them. They missed our summers.|Yea I love it. Lots of people will be pessimistic in conversation about the veterinary industry. Honestly though, I love it and our income/life balance/career opportunities are growing so nicely. Best time to be a vet in history. 

Enjoy the journey|Very true, the nurses need more pay for sure, abysmal really. 

There needs to be a bunch of social shifts and economical revamps to the industry to see a change. 

Support staff in the US aren't exactly earning much in a relative sense, the ratios of vet:vet tech or vet:RVN are the same between nations. (Think approx $180k-200k:70k USD and 140-150k:60k AUD). The main difference is that you can survive better on 70k USD on average. However the radio demonstrates that Aus doesn't support their non vet staff any more or less than the US, the industry as a whole is just less profitable because an RVN is less qualified than a tech.

If they don't pay vets more they will continue to leave overseas. Improved veterinary standards were always going to come before the support staff. It's unfortunately how the economics work. 

The shift is now towards vets doing less consulting and more prescribing/surgery, that and insurance mentality will drive change in the overall pay (but ratios will remain the same).

Its such an odd industry as a whole. That being said, we are all better off than 10 years ago. Support staff and vets.|Yea it's definitely a rose tinted view. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the US industry? I like learning about the other countries situations.",Veterinarian
"31 yo female here. I agree that this topic is not nearly touched upon enough given the fact that majority of us are women! I graduated in early 2022 and started working full time as a GP vet. I got pregnant a few months after starting and continued working full time. Management and staff were extremely supportive and lightened my caseload as things became harder physically. I was able to take 4-5 months of maternity leave and currently I am back at work full time. My son is about 10 months old now. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I do agree that it slowed down my career during my time on maternity leave, but when I returned to work, I returned full force and feel that it gave me a new sense of confidence and purpose. This may differ from your experience being that I was a very fresh grad when I got pregnant with little experience out of school, but I think that you having a few years under your belt gives you an added advantage. 

Regarding whether motherhood has changed my outlook on my career and life, the answer is yes. During school and my first few months out, I was dedicated to the grind and didn’t mind staying late or putting in the extra hours. Now, I ensure that I am efficient during my day and set strict boundaries to leave work at a certain time. I still only get to see my son for about 1-2 hours when I get home to put him to bed. While this truly sucks during the workdays, I appreciate the time spent together so much more on my days off. The time feels more meaningful and I know that my son will one day understand that his mom was out there working hard for him to have a better life. 

That being said, if I had the opportunity to work part time or full time but three days a week for a similar salary, I would absolutely take it. I am interested in having more kids so we’ll see if all of this holds true! Best of luck and remember to think about the long term.",Veterinarian
"A $340,000 loan at 7% for 25yrs has payment of $2404 per month payment, i think you calculated the $40,000 per month incorrectly. The average vet making 125,000/yr salary according to AVMA.  If you work in USA where there is 15,000 vet shortage there IBR and PSLF. The IBR you pay 5% of AGI and with PSLF your loans are payed if you work for non profit for 10yrs. USA really needs large animal vets bc everyone working on dogs and cats.|It is crucial to thoroughly review those numbers. If the cost of obtaining a veterinary license exceeds 1.5 times the debt, it becomes an investment of time and money that may prove challenging to repay.

"A) all cat spays flank with modified millers. I have now opted to just remove ovaries instead of OVH as according to a few studies there is no difference and I find there is less tissue handling. Will do midline spays if pregnant or fancy cat where owner is scared coat will grow back differently. I use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, monofast/monocryl for muscle layers + SC and intradermals

B) cat neuter, incision on each testicle and autoligation. No collar or sutures or glue needed. 

C)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals

D) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. If elderly dog will do scrotal ablation as well as tend to find these get very bruised and huge hematomas. Tend to use monofast/monocryl for ligatures + SC + intradermals but will use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures at times.

Completely agreed. I worked for a corporate and they priced themselves out so far that clients had to pay for their care plans to afford care. So clients had a monthly payment instead of having to pay a much higher one time cost for an annual. However you as the vet receive a significantly smaller commission on their care plans compared to clients on no plan. So it screwed the vets. You better believe they priced it that way on purpose so it’s a win win for them - make more on the client or pay the vet less. Either way the corporate gets more money in their pocket.|I worked for a private hospital and the doctor said to “ignore” the section written about negative accrual on my contract. He said he doesn’t keep track. One year later he asked me for $5000 citing me using me PTO and CE as times when production counted against me and I needed to pay him back. So essentially I paid for my PTO and CE. It was bullshit and I left soon after. Just say no to negative accrual. You don’t need to have a reason. It’s archaic and honestly just breeds distrust with your employer. Vets are in demand. There is no reason to sign a contract with negative accrual or non-competes anymore.,Veterinarian

"Don't let one bad or toxic workplace ruin your vet med career for you. You did the whole education, you worked to this point.
You are describing a horrible workplace you should leave asap. I don't think talking to the owner/boss will change much. I've seen it lots of times: a lot of promises but they don't put it in writing so it's not valid.

Keep searching for a good clinic or practice. There are good managers, there are good clients, there are bosses who dare to say 'we don't have the time or utilities to help you, we'll refer you to X' , there are places where you can learn and grow.
Don't quit vet med before you try out other options.

And if you really don't like practice, check out the other options of your degree. A veterinarian can work for the private sector like pharmaceuticals, food etc, or for the government for food safety.

Don't give up, I believe in you|I like your Facebook page already, keep up the good work|I would not advise you to go to Belgium.

I can only speak from a small animal perspective, but all the big corporations (Anicura, Evidensia, Nesto, etc) promise you a lot but give you little and try to keep you bound to them.

In Belgium, >95% of vets are zelfstandige/freelancer, and are paid between 20-30eu/hour for starters. This rate would be nice if you are on payroll, but as a zelfstandige, it's really not a lot. For comparison, as a zelfstandige it is advised to have an accountant. My accountant charges 85€/h. So I need to work 2.5-3h to pay my accountant 1 hour (of course not counting any vat/taxes/etc for your pay).  
In the Netherlands, you can be a zelfstandige or ZZP'er, they are often paid a lot better (heard things of 70€/h). But mainly, most vets in the Netherlands are on a payroll, which I would advise you to do unless you want to start your own practice/clinic/service.

To clarify about the Corporations binding you: they pay shit and they will tell you right in your face that you are not worth more, even though you will make clients pay 5-10x more for your service than what you get from the corportation in hourly fee.  
But the main thing is that they try to bribe you (convince you the low pay is worth it) with continued education e.g. ESAVS. ESAVS is amazing, worth a lot, but hella expensive. So either you have to work for the corporations for x amount of years, or if you quit sooner, you have to repay them. And we are talking about education worth 4-5 numbers (€XX XXX)

Don't know any details about Germany.

For your last question: I've heard of them but most are either via a corporation or an internship. You're better of working for an experienced vet who wants to learn you things than keep on getting education from people that are no longer active in the field|Oh but that's a whole other story! Then the options are a lot better, and paid a lot better.

But no matter what sector you choose to work is, clinical or pharma or whatever, just remember this:

Working as a zelfstandige is only really interesting if you either earn a loooot of money (100€/h or more) or if you own your own company/service. Not like in the clinics in Belgium where you are paid hourly and low wage (schijnzelfstandigheid, mag eigenlijk niet maar bon).
In all other cases, get payroll en have the courage to ask for a raise if you are doing a good job",Veterinarian

I had lovely classmates (albeit all about ten years younger than me so I wasn’t really involved in any drama), lovely professors (many of whom I’d still feel comfortable calling up to ask questions to this day), a supportive atmosphere, and because I decided I wanted to be well rounded, plenty of opportunity to take lots of large animal and production electives and rotations. As a NYC girl with my only large animal background being that I rode a little, I had zero problems tackling dystocia, colic, choke etc right out of school. 

With the exception of a couple of weeks here and there while on ECC rotations I had great work life balance with plenty of time throughout my four years for outside activities. I didn’t spend a single weekend on campus my entire four years unless I was required to be there for clinics.

Unlike everyone else’s experience, it’s been fine. I don’t we would have survived Covid as smoothly as we did. They buy me pretty much anything I ask for. Wages went up tremendously. They increased prices to clients a ton- now maybe people would argue what is bad, but I’d argue that we’ve been undercharging for our services for eternity and at some point we need to charge appropriately for our skill and services. Yeah it sucks but the cost of EVERYTHING has gone up. A CBC/Chem for the $60 our previous owner was charging wasn’t sustainable. A COHAT at $300 wasn’t going to pay our techs’ salary. I think that was the one thing- some our prices swung too far in the other direction, but they’ve been really receptive to feedback; eg if I think we should charge more for the things that take time and effort and skill and less for the shoppable things that people can get anywhere (like a vaccine or drugs) getting price adjustments has not been difficult. Nobody has EVERY harassed us about our “numbers” explicitly; at MOST it’s been like hey , if a doctor can see two more appointments in a day that would pay for us to get your a virtual scribe so you don’t have to spend as much time doing records. That’s been my experience; YMMV.",Veterinarian
"Hello all, 

I need help distinguishing between animal experience, research, and veterinary experience. I've been working at a veterinary research and diagnostic lab since finishing up undergrad about a year and a half ago. During that time, I gained hands-on animal experience on research farms with and without vets present and laboratory research experiences (molecular biology is my degree). 

I'm hesitant to group all my hours (>3000) into ""Research"" as a decent chunk was performed under direct veterinary supervision. Our lab staff consists of mostly PhDs and a few vets who are not always present.

I am veterinarian. I’m pretty sure I’ll be leaving once my contract is up.|Yeah I’m going to talk to my uvc mentor about the best way to navigate my clinic stressing me out over money and I’ll be leaving once my contract is up.,Veterinarian
"I did surgery through my pregnancy. Totally safe as long as all equipment is up to date and functional. 
But if you’re not comfortable, talk with your doctor and your boss and see if a compromise can be made..|Reasons I didn’t bother to specialize. It was much less stressful to go straight into general practice with fixed hours and a competitive salary than going for an exhausting underpaid internship. Where I did my clinical rotations, the internship salary was like 32,000 a year. With our outrageous student loans, no one could live on that. It’s ridiculous.

I’ve always thought since I was in vet school that the system is broken, but I don’t think it’ll ever be fixed.|Fellow Rossie here 

I hated fourth year clinics. I never thought about quitting because frankly it just wasn’t an option. I was up to my eyes in debt from school and needed to finish so I can get that job and start making real money.

But man I hated clinics. They work you to the bone. I found it draining just as a single person living alone. I can’t imagine having gone through it with a whole family, especially young kids. 

I definitely thought there was a stigma against Rossies too. We def weren’t treated the same as the in state students.

But it was worth it to stick it out. Now I work as a GP 3 days a week, no on call hours, 2-4 weeks of PTO, paid CE and licensing, and lots of support. Oh yeah, a 6 figure salary doesn’t hurt either. 

My advice to you is to power through. Once you get the degree and the license, there are so many doors open to you. You can take a low stress job like at-home euth or GP or just do spay:neuter clinics or whatever you want. Just think of the end goal. You can do this!",Veterinarian

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted.

The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas.

The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas. For $55k, I would rather take on a lower stress 9-5 job that didn’t require all the work and tuition costs to become a vet. I have a fantastic work ethic, and have an advanced degree in a field that is hard to get into. I believe vets should make way more than we do. Do physicians have poor work ethic too because they demand way higher pay than vets?|I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat. 

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later.

I was lucky to get out of the room lol|I am not sure where you are located, or what vet school you attended, but I took my licensing (state license) exam in the US two years after graduating. I sat for the NAVLE (and passed) while I was in vet school, though. For certain states, if you have not practiced in 5 years or more they will make you re-take the NAVLE before allowing you to sit for a state licensing exam. Most state license exams are law-related and have sample questions floating around. The NAVLE has prep programs that are extremely helpful.

"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.


I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""


The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.

My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.

I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. 

I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.

Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.",Veterinarian

Be prepared for long nights, long weeks, and long years.|As someone who knows people looking for path jobs in diagnostics/industry, this information is not current. Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down. Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.|Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it’s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that’s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. 

For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it’s clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don’t know and doctors don’t know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.|I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it. It’s never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitive.

"I want to add a client perspective. 

It’s important that the title usage is consistent across the team to avoid confusion on the client’s end. 

Let’s say I go into the clinic with my hamster and the tech calls someone “Dr. Smith” but doesn’t call OP “Dr. Jones” and just calls her “Linda.”

I’m going to be confused about who the vets are, versus who the techs are, and as to who I should be talking to about which topics. 

I know uniforms may vary, but if I’m a client that doesn’t know what the uniforms mean, again, this inconsistency would leave me confused as to who was who. 

A confused client is a client that’s going to forget about the key information given by the vet, or who is going to forget about 

And…from a client perspective…

If somebody does notice the power dynamic play going on, and the inconsistent usage of language, it makes the entire practice look messy and unprofessional. 

I would also be concerned that a tech with that attitude isn’t being respectful of veterinary standards and protocol, and wonder if that reflects on how they’d treat my pet.",Veterinarian

"I went to a lecture recently and the speaker said everyone always pays attention to new client numbers but not enough on retention. How many of those clients are back within 18-24 months? All of those animals should have needed something in that time frame. Is our communication (namely digital) up to snuff to keep clients engaged and coming back for those wellness and vaccine appointments?

This speaker also did say that the general trend has been business slowing down with a return to pre-pandemic levels for a lot of areas and clinics.

It’s a balancing act for the clinic; is the practice simply not grown enough to support the number of vets they have hired? If so are they anticipating growing into that? Is it just a slow period?

The affordability of school is one of the huge problems and probably the main reason I’d say to beware.

Unless you land gigs where longer term relief is needed like maternity leave or serious injury/illness, you’re facing new situations all the time. New practice environments, different softwares, different staff, different clients and pets. You have to have some combination of being selective of your jobs, being adaptable to a clinic’s working conditions, and being confident and steadfast in the way you do things, even when clients whine about how that’s not what Dr. X does. There are people who thrive with that, but it adds possible extra challenges to contend with day to day, to where I could see a new grad who is not fully competent nor confident in their medicine yet struggling.|You definitely can, there were older people in my class. But plan carefully and reconsider your timeline. 

3-4 years to finish undergrad/your pre req classes.

4 years of vet school. 

1-2 years of internship.

3 year radiology residency. 

So you could definitely be a DVM in 10 years if you start college right away with a full time student course-load, but not a board certified specialist. You may not get into vet school your first attempt, many don't. And radiology is a competitive residency so you could do 1, 2, 3 year internship years with no guarantee of a match. And all those intern and residency years you make poor money for hard work.|You certainly can, and there are some technicians that earn specialty certifications and work at universities or specialty hospitals. 

The fact that you ask that though, sort of tells me you're not really sure what you want to do. Being a vet tech vs a veterinarian are just totally different paths with very different day to day experiences and very different responsibilities and expectations.|Ah! Yes, definitely volunteer and/or work as an assistant and/or kennel help. You'll need animal and veterinary experience hours as well as professors and veterinarians willing to write recommendation letters for you to apply to vet school. Vet tech classes for the most part will not fill prerequisites to apply to a DVM program so it makes little sense to become a licensed technician first.|Seems pretty split among answers and discussions I’ve seen. I know some people love it there, but others find some of their policies problematic. It would be weird having clients everywhere and people watching you do surgery and stuff, but I suppose you can get used to that.

"I went to uni in the UK where they teach flank in lectures, but did all my EMS in the USA/Canada so all my practical training was in the midline approach. I've only ever done midline in practice, but everywhere I've worked I'm usually the only vet using the midline approach in cat spays. 

I've also only ever seen other vets do a pre-scrotal approach to dog castrates in the UK (and that's what I was taught in uni), but I learned both pre-scrotal and scrotal techniques in the US.

There are already many UK companies that offer these services, including Cloud 9 Vets who are nation-wide, and various mobile vets who cover smaller areas. Many vets are attracted to mobile vet practice, including palliative and end of life care, because they enjoy the longer appointment times, better flexibility and work life balance, and being able to support pets and guardians through this emotional and difficult time.|Most of the UK schools have a large graduate-entry program tailored to American applicants. I went to Edinburgh, and I would guess that nearly half my year were from abroad. We also had many mature students, including some people in their 40s.

Answering questions about drugs not prescribed, especially around doses (since many people have Valium/diazepam at home) definitely borders on practicing without a license, which you need to be extremely mindful of.

Literally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn’t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case—the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.

I stuck it out for the full year though—not because I wasn’t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn’t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I’d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

I took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health. I’ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable. 

That’s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.|I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally. I now work for an in-home euthanasia service, and I feel very fulfilled. It’s a much better fit.|I worked a year in GP, feeling the same dread and anxiety you did. It sucked. The anxiety and self-doubt I felt every day was terrible. The only thing that helped me was having a wonderful support system outside of work, AND working at a clinic that had zero tolerance for toxicity. 

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don’t regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

At the end of that year, I bid GP goodbye forever and am now working as an IHE vet and am more content with my life choices than ever. |I just wanted to chime in with a slightly different experience. While it may be very true that, for you, it’s just this clinic that is the problem—it’s also possible that maybe it is general practice itself that you aren’t comfortable with.

I spent a year, miserable, in GP. I actually had a relatively supportive mentor and pretty friendly staff. I was just terrified, everyday, of making a mistake. It was all-consuming. I was miserable on my days off. I would stress about patients when I was home. I hated that appointment times were so short, and that I had to treat each patient and owner so briefly.

"I would look into the animal shelter where you currently work for any job openings as a vet assistant. Your biggest strength will be your ability to handle/restrain animals, so focus on that. There is no shame in using muzzles until you are 100% comfortable. 

After you get some experience, then look into jobs at a GP. Working in GP will allow you to broaden your experience further with more complex surgeries and routine vet care. Working in GP will also allow you more time to go back to school if you decide to do so. 

Now, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go into emergency medicine. I switched from GP to ER 2 years ago and I'll never go back. I'm not licensed (yet), but I still get to do most hands on things, except for what only a licensed tech can do. I focus primarily on inpatient care, so I perform venipuncture, administer medications and treatments, monitor anesthesia, scrub in for surgery, take radiographs, you name it. I make $25 an hour currently and am on track to make $27 by the end of next year. I only make this amount because I work in ER, GP usually pays less. 

I also made the change from corporate America 4 years ago, and I've never looked back. There is a hell of a learning curve, and often pushback depending on your clinic, but it has been so rewarding. Just be patient with yourself because there is a lot to learn, but it will come with time.|It's definitely a thing. It's less common in smaller GPs, but happens alot in ER and specialty.",Veterinarian
"I would reconsider honestly. I wanted to be a vet my entire life and never considered another path. I did everything to get here and once I did, I quickly realized it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. Out of close vet friends only about 30% love the job. I don’t hate being a vet but I imagined something more exciting or rewarding. Most of my day is recommending things to people who don’t want to listen, making estimates/treatment plans and then having people tell me they can’t afford any of it (and then saying we’re in it for the money- btw the money is not great lol) and avoiding getting bit by aggressive Covid dogs with owners who say “oh he’s just warning you!!!” when they’re growling. I’m only 5 years in and I’m already trying to pivot out. 
I’d highly suggest getting your animal fix at a shelter or a volunteer position. The road to becoming a vet is long, expensive with not the best pay off in my opinion.",Veterinarian
"I wouldn't say you're late. I went straight from undergrad to vet school and was 23 when I started, and was one of the youngest in my class. Majority of people took at least one gap year, with 2-3 years being common. My class also had a fair number of people in their 30s when we started, and even one person in their 50s.|Do you have any hands on experience either in a veterinary clinical setting or wildlife rehab? That's your first step. 

Also, don't underestimate the amount you need to interact/work with people in vet med, even with wildlife/unowned animals. Depending on the job, you'll be working with conservationists, game wardens, legislators, rescues/rehabilitators, local community members, foundations, and donors. The job isn't all medicine, in fact, a lot of the job is convicing other people to let you practice medicine.",Veterinarian
"I’m a vet! And as a new graduate in need to learn how to make decisions for yourself, don’t let the owners perspective, cloud your decision.

"I'm also left-handed, and simply learned to use right-handed instruments. Most clinics won't keep both right- and left-handed instruments, and definitely not enough to do multiple surgeries in one day. I'd recommend learning with the right-handed ones anyway. When you're out in practice, if you decide you'd rather use the left-handed ones, you can buy them then or discuss with your employer about getting some.|Definitely! Both of the other vets I work with are left-handed, but we all learned with right-handed instruments, so that's what we use. When I was starting school I had the option to get a left-handed needle driver, but it was MUCH more expensive, so I stuck with the right-handed one.|Agreed that you should focus on getting into vet school first. Your interests might change a lot once you are exposed to different areas of medicine.
That being said, internal medicine is usually split between small and large animal. Neurology (at least where I went to school) technically does both small and large. But practically, they almost never see large animal patients. Very few specialties would see both small and large animals (radiology, derm, and ophtho are more likely to see both).|I've used several different softwares. Cornerstone, Avimark, ezyvet, Vetware, and now Neo. I like Neo the best. It is the most intuitive and easiest to use. I use it now with zero training. It is simple to customize for each practice's specific needs. Having a cloud-based software makes it easy for me to check my schedule and write records or notes from anywhere. While I tend to learn the ins and outs of software easily enough, most staff do not. It makes my life a thousand times less complicated to have software that others can learn quickly too. 
We use idexx in-house blood and urine analyzers, and use idexx reference lab for any samples that need to be sent out also. The software integrates all of the results, attaching results directly into patient's files and sending notifications to the prescribing doctor automatically. 
Of the other softwares I've used, Avimark would come in second place. The rest are just not intuitive at all. I found they tried to incorporate too many functions that it made it much for confusing to do even simple tasks. The cost of some software can also be quite prohibitive, especially for small practices. 
I will say that my clinic has just recently switched from paper records to Neo. Despite knowing there would be hiccups and a learning curve, transitions are never smooth. Many clinics may not want to switch software solely because it is a HUGE headache. Not only in terms of having all the staff trained on the new program, but having all of the records, pricing, inventory, reminders, etc merging to the new software. It has been almost a year of working out all the kinks before and after going live with the new software, and there are still issues regularly.|In terms of customization, SOAP and procedure templates are most important to me. I personally like that I can have a template for a general physical exam, a neuro exam, a cardio exam, etc. I can have a template for surgeries, so it is preset in regards to what meds I'll use and prices set based on size of pet. However, I'm an associate vet, so I'm not sure at this point what options would be most important for management/owners.

Switching from paper records to cloud-based is a LOT of work, because we have to scan the paper records and attach them to the corresponding digital record. Even for a small practice, that's thousands of records. If a practice is already out of the stone age, switching from one software to another would still be quite the hassle. It took months just to get our vaccination reminders to properly transfer from the old software to the new. There was a lot of lost time and things slipping through the cracks as all of the staff get accustomed to the new software.

As for learning curves with new software, I think that part of it is how intuitive it is. But a bigger part is probably that most of the staff in a vet clinic aren't all that tech savvy. I don't think that's specific to my workplace. A lot of people tend to just throw their hands up and admit defeat, saying they aren't good with computers.

It has been almost a year of working out all the kinks before and after going live with the new software, and there are still issues regularly.|In terms of customization, SOAP and procedure templates are most important to me. I personally like that I can have a template for a general physical exam, a neuro exam, a cardio exam, etc. I can have a template for surgeries, so it is preset in regards to what meds I'll use and prices set based on size of pet. However, I'm an associate vet, so I'm not sure at this point what options would be most important for management/owners.

Switching from paper records to cloud-based is a LOT of work, because we have to scan the paper records and attach them to the corresponding digital record. Even for a small practice, that's thousands of records. If a practice is already out of the stone age, switching from one software to another would still be quite the hassle. It took months just to get our vaccination reminders to properly transfer from the old software to the new. There was a lot of lost time and things slipping through the cracks as all of the staff get accustomed to the new software.

As for learning curves with new software, I think that part of it is how intuitive it is. But a bigger part is probably that most of the staff in a vet clinic aren't all that tech savvy. I don't think that's specific to my workplace. A lot of people tend to just throw their hands up and admit defeat, saying they aren't good with computers. I can show somehow how to fix an issue and they will understand and be able to repeat that process themselves. But there are surprisingly few people who will Google a problem (or even search in the provided training manuals) and try to find a solution themselves.|I'm also left-handed, and simply learned to use right-handed instruments. Most clinics won't keep both right- and left-handed instruments, and definitely not enough to do multiple surgeries in one day. I'd recommend learning with the right-handed ones anyway. When you're out in practice, if you decide you'd rather use the left-handed ones, you can buy them then or discuss with your employer about getting some.|Definitely! Both of the other vets I work with are left-handed, but we all learned with right-handed instruments, so that's what we use. When I was starting school I had the option to get a left-handed needle driver, but it was MUCH more expensive, so I stuck with the right-handed one.|Agreed that you should focus on getting into vet school first. Your interests might change a lot once you are exposed to different areas of medicine.
That being said, internal medicine is usually split between small and large animal. Neurology (at least where I went to school) technically does both small and large. But practically, they almost never see large animal patients. Very few specialties would see both small and large animals (radiology, derm, and ophtho are more likely to see both).|I've used several different softwares. Cornerstone, Avimark, ezyvet, Vetware, and now Neo. I like Neo the best. It is the most intuitive and easiest to use. I use it now with zero training. It is simple to customize for each practice's specific needs. Having a cloud-based software makes it easy for me to check my schedule and write records or notes from anywhere. While I tend to learn the ins and outs of software easily enough, most staff do not. It makes my life a thousand times less complicated to have software that others can learn quickly too. 
We use idexx in-house blood and urine analyzers, and use idexx reference lab for any samples that need to be sent out also. The software integrates all of the results, attaching results directly into patient's files and sending notifications to the prescribing doctor automatically. 
Of the other softwares I've used, Avimark would come in second place. The rest are just not intuitive at all. I found they tried to incorporate too many functions that it made it much for confusing to do even simple tasks. The cost of some software can also be quite prohibitive, especially for small practices. 
I will say that my clinic has just recently switched from paper records to Neo. Despite knowing there would be hiccups and a learning curve, transitions are never smooth.

"I'm on the PSLF route and I work in the non-profit vet world (think shelter medicine, high quality high volume spay/neuter). I cannot imagine doing anything else. All I've ever wanted to be is a vet. It's been a bumpy ride. I'm 8 years out and have finally figured out how to make this work for me mentally, physically, etc. 

  
1. You have to be thinking about loans and actively make a plan as to how you're gonna pay them back. This also requires a lot of self-study about finances, loans, paperwork etc  (I realized PSLF and doing non-profit work was a win-win for me but I sustained a lot of workplace trauma trying to find the right fit. There's annual paperwork involved.  I'm committed to 10 years of nonprofit/government work).  
2. You have to stand up for yourself, including leaving jobs you hate even when its hard to walk away; you need to know when you're being abused by your employer. You have to actively get yourself out of shitty situations that usually involve difficult people and sometimes money. It's awkward, there's lots of feelings, it sucks.   
3. Create a life outside of vet med. This sounds easy before you go to vet school, but studying and then post-grad learning/working consumes your life. You become used to working so hard, its naturally easy to just become a workaholic as there's always room for improvement. You have to find a healthy balance and maintain relationships or you will be unhappy.

I don't need to do it all anymore because I have and its burnt me out multiple times. I have found what I'm good at and don't bite off more than I can chew. If I could do it all over again I would have advocated for myself more. I would have trusted my intuition and quit jobs I knew weren't working for me, even if that meant breaking a contract or potentially living off savings for a bit.

"I’ve been out 14 years and I do think that your time off should be yours. 

However, I knew nothing when I graduated from vet school and I wasn’t even aware of how little I knew, but I did do an internship and residency and spent four extra years giving up my time off to learn. 

I still stay up night desperately researching cases, but much more of my time off is protected now.

I think you have to find a balance. It isn’t wrong to set boundaries, but especially as a new grad you have to recognize that your growth will be hampered by you not taking the extra time to learn. You will eventually get where you want to be, but more slowly. And you may make mistakes along the way.

I think you should have a frank discussion with your boss about how to achieve your goal of improving and also protecting your time off as much as possible. If they aren’t willing to work with you, there are lots of practices who will.

Only dvms I know that are unhappy are corporate dvms that have to abide by the corp bullshit that anyone has a dislike for. You ain’t happy where you at then fix it. Quit complying. 

This poor clinic just askin about how to find a vet now has to weed thru all this bullshit for no real answer other than find a non lgbtqia+-= male dvm. Otherwise it seems like a headache.|It is disappointing  to feel like the work ethic of this industry has declined over the last 20 years. 15 years ago new grads could expect base $55k with about 6/7% production. Now they are getting $100k 2/4% production with much better benefits and work life balance. Not to mention the sign on bonus that corporate groups are giving the new grads. All tides turn in time. I think you’ve got a hell of an offer regardless of what the states reproductive rights are.|Touché|When the commenters here merely state TEXAS!?!? Fuck texas and their anti feminist anti gay bullshit? Clearly that’s someone watching too much news and not living day to day here. Op didn’t even mention extended benefits and everyone slammed it as it’s a texas problem. It’s not a texas problem. Obviously it’s a workforce problem when the women are too scared or stubborn or both to come to a place that will pay them fairly. As op stated a pretty fair wage as far as I’m considered and still not knowing exact details.|Never once did I say pull anything up by any bootstraps. Y’all putting words in my mouth. And vary rarely is an abortion life threatening. To wait a week or less to travel to an area that allows it isn’t difficult. Please stay wherever you are and advocate whatever you want. This tribalism of red vs blue is only compounding this and many other issues.|If you can’t abort an unwanted pregnancy shouldn’t you be taking the act of unprotected sex into consideration as well. Don’t want a baby? There’s ways to prevent it to begin with….|You can always travel for repro rights. Not a difficult concept. And most Texans don’t give a shit what you identify as as long as you don’t push your shit on us who cares what you do. Turn the tv off and have some conversations with people. The difference isn’t a wide gap and we tend to agree on most things. Y’all too worried about what msnbc or fox as to say about it. Their are not our puppet, or yours. Quit acting like it. And yeah I do believe the system can change. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve lived the change. To discount a place because of international food? You have clearly never experienced the vast culinary melting pot of many texas cities. Too stuck in your own existence to experience what different places have to offer. Keep yourself where you are it’s your mindset that keeps shit stagnant.|I question your intelligence in the face of your advanced degree. Learn the industry and you may surprise yourself. Fucking clowns.|Supply and demand affect these rates the most. Start hurting for vets the wages go up. Also the type of medicine they practice matter. Small animal vs large animal, ecg.|Soooo if 15 years ago the going rate for a new grad was $55k and now, most places I deal with are offering $100k…… it’s not quite double but pretty darn close. Seems like pay is keeping up with most things. Again you don’t like your current situation, there are others to be had. There is just a lack of doing so for whatever reason you want to point out. I most commonly see what I see.|To say politics is the reason they can’t hire anyone is flat bullshit that only the weak and simple minded allow them to let it affect them like that.|I would question her place of employment instead of the state she lived in. That’s dumb.|I wouldn’t require someone to do something with their body they didn’t want to. It’s not my decision. And if the govt says it’s a must, well time to adapt right? I personally wouldn’t fire someone because they chose to or not to get something that’s voluntary. I helped my people look for alternatives to vaccination. Medical/religious exemptions. Flat saying no thanks no poke for me. I let my people choose. Honestly great point! Maybe we will implement some sort of compensation for women in my org that need to travel to get the medical care they require. I could even implement it for the opposite of women that need help getting pregnant. Looky here something positive from this shit storm.|Lol obviously not. But if I found myself in that situation I’ve got bigger fish to fry than an unwanted pregnancy. If that’s your true worry maybe you should reassess your surroundings…possibly a state that allows open carry of a firearm might deter any unsavory types that could lead to said unwanted pregnancies?|Okurrr. Just look at movement maps during Covid. One of the most blue states, California, had more residents move from there to texas… Jesus y’all need to pop another ssri and chill. How do you think those drugs y’all are on for such a hard life y’all have had affect a fetus?|Never said I wanted them to that it was justified that they made that. It’s much different now especially in my area of texas, the average salary is $100k plus production for even a new grad.|My reason and logic seem to confuse even the most basic of individuals. My intelligence should a always be questioned. As should yours. If we are not flexing the gray matter on a daily basis we are but withering away.|That’s ignorant to leave the industry because your not getting paid what you are worth. Find a place that will pay. They are everywhere. Of the 1000 plus vet clinics in my part of the world 80% are looking for a dvm and will pay $100K + incentives. Open your eyes. Either that or these drs leaving want to work 10-4 with a 2 hour lunch and 2 months pto. Oh and only want vaccine appointments because they aren’t comfortable in sx or more difficult cases. That’s the lack of gumption I speak of.|No one said to take out student loans. I know dvms that floated their schooling and I know ones that did take loans out and paid it off in 3 years because they busted ass. The way some of these commenters are talking they be living at the clinic so what mortgage? (Joking don’t downvote me more). Sure things are more expensive I get that, everyone feels that bite. But if your wages in the profession are up you should still just as easily meet those obligations just as the dvms of 15 years ago did. I’m no math expert but I can do that math.|As the saying goes scared money don’t make money. It’s like saying I won’t work in Houston because of greenspoint. Well why not Conroe instead? Might as well not go to New York either since we ship both the immigrants and our stray dog population there. Oh no, the migrant flow continuesssssss|It’s only hostile to them because they let it be. Ok my state says I can or can’t do something, doesn’t mean I have to abide by that. I bet you never speed do you? That’s the state telling you what you can and can’t do with your body too isn’t it? A bit oversimplified but the same concept. Y’all too worried about red vs blue or they vs them. You do you boo but please stay the fuck away from this state and it’s wonderful people. There’s a saying for a reason, don’t California my Texas. The anger and downvotes I’ve gotten in this thread is hilarious. All the while I just laugh continue about my day. I bet y’all going home and crying to your spouse about the unhinged asshole on Reddit. Cry into your pillow, no one cares.|Idk if you read my last comment. I literally just said I would like to look into compensation for women that require or want such care. It’s not their fault texas has this issue and they shouldn’t suffer, no one should, because of it. I’m not denying anything. If anything I’m looking to facilitate their choice…even would like to go as far as helping the women whom want to become pregnant that can’t… I fail to see your issue here.|Please read above. I stated I helped my people find alternatives. Religious and medical exemptions… I fail to see the issue…|Daily. I welcome it. If I don’t challenge my customers and they don’t challenge me it’s a boring life. Hell, if I don’t challenge myself how boring. I’ll be the first to admit when I’m wrong as well. Hence how I’ve made it to where I am in life and in this industry. Just because I don’t have some advanced degree from some prestigious institution doesn’t mean I lack in intelligence. I’ve given my life to this industry just as many veterinarians have. I’m not so pretentious that I can’t see the Forrest for the trees. This answer is simple. Your undervalued and overworked? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! The clinic you work at isn’t the only one, it’s not your only option. Not in Texas, not in Idaho. No matter where you are or want to be there are many options for yourself. You just have to take the initiative, rely on yourself, no one else.|If you can’t afford to live and work where you currently are, and feel undervalued I would imagine doubling your base salary and increasing your other benefits would entice you to make the move across the country. No high horse just the reality of where I am at. I’m not happy where I’m at or getting paid what I’m worth I’m actively looking for a place I will be satisfied. Simple as that. And maybe they would off themselves if they realized that was an opportunity.|16 I know paid it off within 3 years. All of them in the last 8 years. How did they pay it off within 3 years of graduation you ask? By busting their ass and living below their means. Taking extra shifts at other hospitals. Hell one of them worked in industry, worked overnight ec and lived like they were in college still. It can happen. It does happen. Funny thing is we can circle back to work ethic and gumption. Those that choose to pay their loans off over the long haul, typically lack some of those two qualities. Or extenuating circumstances create issues paying off loans that fast. The power of simple math fired the ass busters up and they made it happen for themselves.|Yes customers. I spent 10 years in practice. In every role. As a industry consultant I speak with customer, vet clinics, all over the country. I advise them to stay away from and to not hire clown acts like yourself. Just because I currently reside here doesn’t mean my view point would be different if I lived somewhere else. Like when I lived in California for 6 years. Still a consultant in the industry I directed my customer, clients, what have you on how to best run their business. Staying away from problem or toxic employees is at the top of the list. If you are a veterinarian I feel terrible for your clients and your business. Maybe it’s not suffering now but a room full of toxic bullshit always boils over.|I haven’t screamed once. And considering I’ve had to weather all types of economic storms I’m pretty well versed on it. Also, thanks for assuming the adversities I have faced in life. But if you must know my back story here’s a snippet. Grew up poor, busted my ass to put myself thru school and worked tirelessly for an industry I love and have literally almost died for. Yet I’m still here fighting the good fight. Politics be damned.|I would check diagnostic and distribution companies. There’s all types of remote dvm roles. Something like idexx, telehealth or corporate veterinary groups. Not sure if any of those are in Germany but it’s worth a shot.",Veterinarian

"Like another poster said, 'loop mee' with a few veterinarians. Preferably several different ones. Every veterinarian and practice is different. You can also check out vets for different species, like horses, exotics, birds, companion, veearts etc. This exploration of the actual daily job beforehand is important. A lot of students quit, because it is way different than expected. It's not just cuddling puppies. It's a lot of working with humans too, and sad and frustrating moments. It's also amazing if you enjoy biology, medicine, learning how the body works etc. It's also very afwisselend, not a 9-5 sit on a desk chair kind of job. There are a lot of job options, so you could explore further what you like when studying. Many vets switch at least once between jobs like food industry, research or between different species.

The job is rewarding but tough, the same goes for the studies. Go to the open days in Utrecht and Belgium. Remember getting in is hard as well, have a plan b. I think there is still an option to switch to the master veterinarian medicine if you finish the bachelor animal sciences in Wageningen and choose a specific course. 
You could go for Ghent or Antwerp too, but those courses are quite tough on Dutch students, because of the cultural differences and differences in school systems. If you're good at studying loads of info in ridiculous detail, Belgium could suit you though. Unfortunately, they have an entrance exam now, which is very hard to pass. So prepare to study hard for that test if you go that road.

It's definitely not a requirement, but if you manage to find some side job related to animals or even at a veterinarian practice, you can get used to different animal species and also see what interests you.

I *love* advanced medicine, and learning, and teaching, and research, and I would have made a damn good resident and internist. 

But I want to see my fucking family, and ride my horse, and sleep more than 4 hours a night, and pay off my $300k student loans.

And so I watch the increasingly desperate ads from vet schools for interns, residents, and clinicians and wonder what they'll do when there's no one left.|I was close friends with some residents and interns in my fourth year, and it physically pained me to see people call them bitchy and complain about them when I had watched those same residents and interns cry in front of me because they were so tired and overworked. Should they be lashing out? In theory, I'd love to say no. But it's pretty hard to be a sunny disposition and not get frustrated when you're running an entire hospital service with only students for help, your attending is MIA, and you haven't slept in 24 hours. 

The trickle down misery is so real|I don't have a lot of suggestions, but I just wanted to say that we as veterinarians really appreciate that someone who isn't involved AT ALL in vet med cares so much about this topic that they looked into it and are interested in helping. 

Perhaps reaching out to the AVMA (the national group that is in charge of oversight of the vet school programs and such) and expressing your concern as a pet owner that veterinarians are experiencing poor working conditions and you want to know what they're doing about it.

One of the problems is that there seems to be no oversight: the AVMA likes to put out pretty words and ""suggestions"" like restrictions on student hours spent in clinics, but there are no consequences for programs that don't follow these restrictions. What this results in is that young vets are ""talking with their actions"" and not doing internships and residencies...which is going to (and has already) lead to shortages in specialties or select for people who don't care about fairness and just keep the same attitude, rather than anything changing. Maybe if the big organizations realized the general public is aware of their dirty laundry and concerned about their transparency and the blind eye they're turning, they would do a little more.|Lmao this reminds me of our communication training. We had ""scenarios"" with paid actors, whom we had to placate and cater to and never ever be honest with despite ridiculous scenarios- one of them was a man with a cat who ate a vegetarian diet because he was vegan and the scenario was that his cat had heart failure and he refused to give it meat/taurine. 

I also was once told that ""I didn't show enough empathy,"" to a client whose fake cat had kidney failure. The way I approached it was to explain what kidney failure was, gave them the options, and then waited for them to process it and remained a calm sounding board and answer their questions. Wtf did they want, for me to cry with the fake client over their fake cat? 

Not once has anything from that stupid class ever helped me, and I always thought the way they coached you to speak sounded extremely condescending, like you were talking to a child.

Edit: FWIW, I have received rave reviews from my bosses about my communication with clients, even clients who have been prickly about seeing ""the new vet"" in the past. So whatever I'm doing is working|I can probably elaborate on what the previous poster is dancing around. What if your mentor isn't doing a good job, and you don't feel like you can go to them (or they're taking advantage of you- giving you cases that aren't good learning opportunities, being unavailable when you need help, etc.) but they're also your boss? How do you approach issues in your learning or place in a clinic when you are worried about your job security because the person you should be able to go to for advice is also the one screwing you over?|Where did you go?!? My experience was similar to OPs although we had more opportunities to get large animal and exotics experience because our clinical schedule was very customizable. But everything else held true. I regularly pulled 80-90 hour work weeks between treatments, on call, weekend treatments, and paperwork.|I didn't go to either, but I've heard good things about both. I've only known one person who went to Davis but she really liked it, I've known a few who either went to or worked with students from NC state and NC state sounds like maybe it coddles them a bit and makes it hard to get the experience needed to be a competent doctor fresh out of school (ie limited opportunities to do things like equine GP work because they don't have that as a rotation, less chances to put in catheters because techs do it most of the time unless you're really self-motivated and insist on doing it).

Definitely don't just take my word for this as most of it is second hand, I went to neither. I think both are likely good schools|We autoligated almost all our cat spays (even pregnant...) when I was doing a shelter med rotation. It made me incredibly anxious at first and I did not enjoy it but I eventually warmed to it. I had several I insisted on throwing ligatures on because I felt the pedicle was fraying too much to be comfortable pulling it enough to autoligate. It is tricky to maneuver the mosquitoes to grab the pedicle in the right spot to ligate, but there were only one or two ovaries (out of like 7 cats) that I genuinely couldn't get it, and the more experienced surgeons did it just fine. I'm not positive but I think we autoligated male dogs as well?

I LOVED autoligating male cats, very efficient, similar to a horse castration (my chosen field).

I just hate surgeries in general and am very happy never spaying a cat or dog again!|The uterus we did with sutures, miller knots. But the ovary was autoligated similar to the testicle, clamping and twisting the pedicle around the mosquitos as close to the ovary as possible, then snipping off the horn/ovary, and doing the little autoligation push. I had a few where the pedicle sheared and tore while I was pushing the pedicle off the mosquitoes (I always noticed it before fully releasing, so no bleeding) and those ones I just kept my mosquitoes in place and slipped a millers knot down over my mosquitoes to tie deeper into the body cavity, and then ""finished"" the autoligation. It always felt more risky than the neuters, it didn't feel like a super secure grip on the pedicle to me. But it worked great in a shelter med setting with limited resources I guess 🤷‍♀️|Huh that's interesting. Yeah it's definitely a bit awkward.

Maybe a question once every other day about something minute, and she complained to the manager saying that if she has to help me then she wants half of the production

I also never worked in gp before (I have a strictly wildlife only background) so i don’t know if this behavior is normal or not. So I look up everything. Ive looked up leg amputations, cystotomies, foreign bodies, and most things I feel is OK for a GP to do and isn’t super complex

It was annoying but mentally not bad for me. I know that as long as I understand the theory behind what I’m doing and listen to specialists on youtube / few websites who give their insight, itll be alright. Especially parts where they talk about common mistakes they see in GP, I feel that is super valuable too. Usually theres some bit about that in any article

After I told the guy who hired me about that, I work alone now and I much prefer it. Though it would still be nice to have someone else around to get their thoughts on complicated cases.

Pretty much as soon as I realized that, it stopped mattering to me. Also I look up a lot of stuff and its not a big deal too, a lot of my seniors did the same. They learned most of their surgeries from youtube and a few sites (like vetfolio, dvm360, cliniciansbrief, etc) and I’m doin the same

As for interviewing during rotations, everyone does this differently. I used externships as interviews. Others did half-day working interviews during rotations or used vacation time. At this point your school people will be aware that you and your peers will be doing some serious job hunting and most rotations were fine with people taking a few hours off during some day, as long as it was cleared in advance.|Female, VA.

They have been relatively hands-off in terms of how we are allowed to practice medicine and if the clinic does well then the support staff gets a big chunk of the extra profit at the end of the year.

I also received offers from Banfield (too corporate for me) and an SVP (Southern Vet Partners) clinic and the SVP offer had much more corporate red flags hidden in the small print and there was no focus on the support staff in their mandates.|My experience with the mentorship program they have has been overall positive, but I do think this depends greatly on the doctors and management at the individual practices too. We are basically assigned a mentor, should have weekly meetings with them, and our schedules should overlap closely with theirs. The management at my clinic has been very focused on ""Do not drown the new grad, ease into things"" which is not the situation at every place. 

&#x200B;

I do know one new grad at a different MVP clinic whose assigned mentor went on maternity leave 2 months after she started and she was left hanging a bit.

"Probably true. Maybe not official offers, with contract to sign and every laid out. But honestly, it’s not that hard to get an offer. Especially from a corporation. Clinics are desperate. The externships I did always told me “let us know if you’re interested and we’ll send you an offer”

But why does it matter how many offers you’re getting anyway? I decided on my top 2 clinics after externships, both gave me offers upon request, no interview required unless I had questions for them.

Obviously you can specialize and things would look different, but most of us end up in small animal GP to start.

Vet school. The hardest part is NOT getting in as much as people want to make that joke. It’s hard to get in. It’s harder to stay motivated to finish. It’s crappy. There’s too much knowledge to retain, more than half of it won’t ever apply (but you need to know it to pass boards), and yet you’re still never really prepared for the real world. It’s so costly (I had really good undergrad scholarships, commuted, and only paid about $10k total, but vet school… $$$$$$).

Being a vet. The hardest part is not putting down animals. That’s what naive people think. That decision is hard for the pet owner. The vet is just there to provide the service. It’s actually sometimes one of the better parts. The hard parts are being over worked, not having enough trained support staff, dealing with difficult or uneducated owners, and not having work life balance. You can get great pay as a vet. But is it worth it to not have a life outside of work? No. Some days I don’t see my toddler because I don’t get home until she’s asleep. Sometimes you don’t get a lunch break. Sick days? Better figure something out because you have patients that need to be seen. Long vacations? If you even get enough time off, you better plan those way in advance. The good parts of the job— leaving on time (rare), seeing the human-animal bond, figuring out a challenging case, CE conventions and being with people who understand the high level stress job.

My advice? Work a a clinic, see the stress firsthand. That’s your future. Go to college, take random classes that peak your interest- photography? History? Earth science? A new language? Art?

3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything.

Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything. 

Good luck!|Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it.

"So.... back in like, the early Cretaceous when I was in school (not at Purdue) it was very similar. Everyone sleeping with each other were used to after three years of it- students, faculty, faculty spouses- you name a combination, it happened. The insane work load (we were expected to staff the wards overnight in addition to 8am classes AND 12-14 hr days in the clinic) we could deal with.   
The toxic behaviour not so much. My class sued a couple of our profs, I think, and got one thrown out of the classroom for sexual harassment, though he kept his job. So it has been done.   
These days, knowing what I know now, I would urge you and your classmates to go the state and federal regulatory route. Call OSHA. Call your state radiation permit/oversight agency. Hell, call the labor dept and ACLU over the pregnancy thing. Filing complaints with the site visit team is a little more fraught, but might carry more weight or yield more immediate results.   
Also totally a legit course to simply put your head down and grind if that is what you need to do to get out. It sounds like you're to the point where you feel you have to take action though. Whatever you choose to do, good luck, and thanks for caring and wanting to make the situation better in the future!|Thirty years in practice. Seen this way more than once.

"Spaying can be a difficult procedure, especially for beginners. Here are some tips and tricks that you may find helpful:

* **Find a mentor:** One of the best things you can do is find a more experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician who can mentor you and guide you through the process. They can answer your questions, provide feedback on your technique, and help you troubleshoot any problems you encounter.
* **Start with small animals:** If you're new to surgery, it's a good idea to start with smaller animals, such as kittens or puppies. This will allow you to gain experience and confidence before moving on to larger animals.
* **Practice on models:** There are a number of surgical models available that you can use to practice your technique. This can be a great way to get comfortable with the instruments and procedures before you operate on a live animal.
* **Watch videos:** There are many great videos available online that can teach you about spaying. Look for videos that are specifically geared towards beginners.
* **Take a course:** There are a number of courses available that can teach you about spaying. These courses can be a great way to learn from experienced professionals and get hands-on experience.

"Still in my first job as a vet nurse. I walked in feeling like I knew absolutely nothing. Wasn't sure how people would prefer me to restrain, and I swear I had to ask everyone else to place catheters because I just couldn't get them in. Now a little over 3 months later I've found my footing. I have no problems with catheters, picking drug protocols for anaesthetisia, giving advice and helping the newer nurses. 

The key to getting better is tackling the things that you find the hardest. I placed IV catheters in all the surgical patients every day until I got better. Pick one thing you struggle with and tackle it for a week or two. Ask for help and tips along the way, and in no time you'll be brilliant! It just takes practice and help from the team. Best of luck!|I'd try Europe. Poland is quite popular even for people in other European countries. Cheaper tuition and living costs, it's taught in English. And easy to move to another country after. Usually just a bit of paperwork and one exam.|Everyone makes mistakes. I'm a nurse but fucked up this week. Had a dog in recovery post spray seem lethargic, only when checking the gums did we notice they were white. The dog almost died from a splenic bleed, only that another nurse checked the gums did the dog survive. 

The vet doing the spray is 25+ years as a vet and owns the practice and I'm a new nurse. I don't know if the dog survived the night, but if it did its thanks to the other nurse (and a quick blood transfusion).",Veterinarian
"Thank you for sharing this. I think we as a field need to have more self awareness that plenty of people in vet med pull the same shit. It comes down to control/loss of control etc etc we could banter all day long but we all just gotta do our jobs, hold boundaries with people who suck and move on.",Veterinarian
"Thanks! It should be about an 8 hour surgery day. 
Yes the 501c3 is in the works. 
I’m doubtful we’ll be able to hire a full-time veterinarian. There are neighboring counties that are all incredibly short staffed that are not able to hire DVM’s or tech. They also pay less than the rates I’ve stated above, but I still want to be competitive since I’ll be recruiting from the surrounding cities (5-6 hours away)
I’m hoping that it will be possible to get full time staff once we are established.|Yes that’s definitely a concern. The point is that it’s unlikely we’ll be able to hire a full time Vet- so if we can staff it with relief/ contract vets it might be more successful. Most of the human medical clinics in the area do that because there are so few providers.
I have 4 DVM’s who are interested in working here on a rotating basis. It’s a very desirable area to visit, close to a national monument and national parks, it’s becoming a more popular tourist destination so that’s why I’m hoping the travel stipend and the lodging for the weekend would be an incentive. I’m also planning to offer a night or two on the shoulders of the clinic days so they can stay longer and actually enjoy the area and not just be working. Do you have any feedback on the per diem rates that I stated above?|Thanks! 
I plan to verify income based on the most recent paystub. It’s a seasonal tourist community so people’s incomes fluctuate a lot. 
We’ll have at least one DVM who will approve all the SOP’s and one CVT on the board of directors. I’ll be the only full time staff member initially with a part time administrative assistant. We’ll be in charge of ordering, inventory, record keeping, maintenance etc. The plan would be to hire another full time CVT after the first year. Our focus will be S/N wellness, vaccines. I’ll also collaborate with the DVM’s in neighboring communities for referrals for any illnesses or serious accidents. I’m hoping some of the revenue can go into an Angel fund that can support people in getting their pet to a regular vet for those types of things. It’s a small community, lot of people here can’t afford to drive that far, may not even have a car that can make it over a mountain pass, etc.|Yeah I’m concerned about not being able to generate enough revenue from services to cover a full-time vet. I’m planning on doing a survey to gather data on household income, how many pets per household, and affordability of services. My tentative plan for pricing is to offer free or 5 dollar vaccines for the lowest income bracket. If we do it that way there’s a good chance we can get grants to cover the vaccine cost to the clinic. $for staffing is my biggest hurdle right now. According to county data the average household makes between 40k-60k per year but it’s hard to predict what the average person can afford because there’s a huge wealth gap.|That’s how I’d like to start our clinic too. Similar to what I’ve done in HVSN with very basic wellness services. I’ve been told by friends that in this part of the country the average rate for a relief DVM is 85-100 an hour. That’s why I was thinking $750 for an 8 hour day. It’ll be easier to budget for set per diem rates rather than pay per hour. But I think it’s possible to bump it to $850 per day, the travel stipend will be coming from different funding. (We’re applying for a lot of different grants, plus hoping to get a decent amount of private donations, and in-kind donations for equipment and supplies at least for the first year) then figuring out if we can sustain it just off of donations for services.|Also a concern I have (like you mentioned) is getting experienced DVMs who have the ability to do a high volume of surgeries per day. It seems like the organizations I’ve worked for who do HVSN don’t have a hard time recruiting vets at lower rates but that’s been mostly on reservation areas.|Thanks!

Is it on you? Yes, in the sense that if a board or insurance complaint ever happens…..you are the one responsible for documentation of the case. I don’t think it’s on you, however, to have to enforce what the owner should. Medical records are legal documents; I weigh the owner took it more seriously.

You mentioned there’s an office manager-you’re doing the right thing by communicating with her; maybe the legwork she will have to do, along with your dissatisfaction with the current system, will get the owner’s attention.

What kind of system are you using? I’m assuming it’s paperless-can’t they just enter them then and there? 

Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork? Could you have a more serious sit-down with powers that be?

One great idea my friend has who owns a specialty hospital is to pay for pet insurance for each employee. I’m going to look into that! Who in God’s name is paying techs $10/hour?//|I was in your shoes about two years ago! I’ve been in practice for 20 years, own a hospital, and finally have enough staff to consider what I actually want. I looked hard into a non-traditional residency. I wrote letters, actually found mentors, the whole nine yards.

The further I got in the process, the more uncomfortable it felt. The program was going to take 4-5 years; like you, I‘m not near a university, so the entire time away was like 28 non-consecutive weeks. Not terrible, but something to be considered.

i began to wonder if that amount of academia was what I really wanted. I think I finally realized I wanted something more in my life-  but board certification wasn’t it. I actually became a firefighter and EMT-it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.   


Maybe a residency at a specialty practice would be far more tolerable to someone who’s been in the real world for a while.   


Yes, it's possible, and I’m sure you can do it. No, it’s not crazy. I think if you can practice for at least ten years a a boarded radiologist, then the time investment pencils. Best of luck to you!|Working from home does sound like heaven 🤣|I have to respectfully disagree. I’ve mentored a lot of young vets, and never felt the need for a power dynamic. I thinks it’s part of the profession that we mentor new graduates. They need it, and they need someone who’s present In the same facility.|&#x200B;

I misspoke by using the word “need,” I agree. But again, I’m not sure why you think a power dynamic is such an inevitable conclusion to a mentorship. For twenty years, my hospital has had interns, new grads, relatively new grads and support staff who all needed mentorship or collaborative advice.I think perhaps we have a different view of mentorship. To me, it’s a vet on site who helps you m make medical and surgical decisions in real time. Mentorship can also help with the pressures and daily ups and downs of the profession. Having a mentor nearby the first time something detrimental happens with a patient is a very, very valuable thing. 

If I had a new grad who had an off site mentor and kept calling them on the phone all day, I would certainly feel like the employee’s attention was divided. It would be an absurd system.   


Most veterinary schools have ample resources for help with contract negotiation. To your other point, an “ethical situation that they’re not ready for their boss to know about:” yikes. When do they discuss it with their boss? After they’ve covered it up? Spoken to resources outside the hospital and broken confidentiality?   


Again, we have quite different ideas about mentorship. I’m curious ; where are you in your career?   


Also, could you expound on the nature of the “power dynamic?”|I’m not an attorney, but I suspect the charge isn’t as important as the sentence; if you’re convicted of a felony, it may be difficult to get a DEA, and many employers draw the line at that conviction.

"This is my biggest sticking point for corporate medicine. My boss wants to have a video chat once weekly that I just say I’m too busy for half the time and I barely have to interact. Meanwhile, the privately owned practice I worked in previously had the owner entering the exam room to question doctors in front of clients all the time and then would want to be joking around afterward. Are ya kidding?  

The non-veterinarian behind a desk in a different state setting my expected patients/surgeries per day is annoying, but the day to day is so much better. It’s maybe more soulless, but until I feel like opening my own, it’s either corporate or relief for me.|I guess a question I’d ask is, why can’t you afford a $120k salary on the east coast in a HCOL area? A doctor working ~40hr in a HCOL should be making plenty to warrant their salary unless you don’t have enough appointments to facilitate that? In which case you’re not ready for another doctor anyway.|If I’d have to put money down, I’d have to bet that it was either someone in SA community practice or someone in ECC that made the posture comment?|If it makes you feel any better, almost every vet I’ve spoken with has this experience no matter the school they went to. And I went to Purdue and didn’t think the experience was as bad as described. It’s absolute dog shit, almost every rotation has a few bad eggs with some have nearly all, but that’s also life a lot of the time. I found it easier to bond with the residents (regardless of age) who would then make the grading a hell of a lot easier. I never got any criticism that wasn’t legit or that I at least could look at and say, “well yeah, I’m still learning”. 

Just be prepared to be labeled a Rossie by the students until “proven otherwise”. People can be hypercritical until they realize every cohort has their strong and weak students; as long as you’re not a bum, you’ll kill it. Don’t fret the next two months.|As far as I’ve read, recent studies show no association with FISS with the current Imrab rabies vaccine. I have the same concern in the back of my mind with it, but evidence based medicine is the standard.|Hey, as a more recent grad, I’ll share my experience. We had the same people come to us saying the same things about not making production your first year. 

I worked at a busy (not kinda busy, not very busy, just normal busy) 4 Doctor GP practice and worked about 40hr/wk. Decent split between wellness and sick visits, solid number of surgeries, etc. I didn’t make production my first month due to doing all sorts of admin stuff, occasional shadowing in the first two weeks, etc. I made production every other month from then onward. 

It truly will depend on where you end up working - if you’re in a MCOL city and above, you’ll absolutely make production. I have a few friends from school that did have some negative accrual, but they worked in more LCOL areas (think middle of the country). 

As much as money is important, I wouldn’t stress too much about the production aspect. Ask for 20% because it’s standard and be done with it. Negotiate for the highest salary you can and remember that you’re in charge - there’s a vet shortage that gives you *much* more negotiation power. Being a new grad lowers that obviously. However what you should push for in terms of salary varies widely on where you live. Out of school in a MCOL I got $100,000/yr in salary. 

Also try to get any sign on bonus you can and push for it to be for only ONE year. Definitely not 3.|Spays are the worst surgery no matter how deep into the profession you are. I still very much hate them to this day. You should not feel incompetent. 

We also all make mistakes. Just today I diagnosed atresia ani on the kitten’s SECOND visit to me. I think back about how I should’ve been paying attention to the fact there was no rectum (the patient had a rectovaginal fistula so I initially thought the vagina was the rectum and wasn’t thinking to look at a vagina at all - always do a full PE). It sucks but I learned. 

I struggled hard for the first few months/year(s) in separating my work from my life outside of work. It’s a good idea to set time aside like you’ve said for continued learning outside of the pressure of appointments but also remember you’re more than a veterinarian and *should* be more than a veterinarian. You will grow even faster if you’re mentally well rested. Find ways to disconnect. It won’t always be perfect, I can still have a weekend ruined by overthinking on cases. But I’m so much less anxious when I’m not thinking about it at all. 

You’ve got classic imposter syndrome to a degree like everyone else who just graduated. And to some extent, there IS a ton of stuff you don’t know. But you made it through vet school which means I know you’re more than capable of picking things up quick. Keep caring for your patients as much as you can and good luck to you!",Veterinarian

PCA/VCA is a really good starting point as you will get an honest view of the profession to decide if you want to jump into training as an RVN or not. Veterinary can be a very fulfilling profession if you can find the right practice to fit you. There are many options once qualified aswell.

Veterinary isn't just all hugging puppies and kittens, its very emotionally demanding. You will see people at their best and worst. You need to like working with people as much as animals in this job to survive. I hope you have a strong stomach as well cause you will see some sights.

Nothing. Consider your options wisely though. You can do the American Bachelors degree follow by DVM pathway.

I created flashcards for the power pages and power lectures as well.|So toxic that this is downvoted lol|I forgot a fair amount of what I learnt in my first couple years of vet school by the time I was graduating honestly (5 year undergraduate degree, I still passed the NAVLE on the first attempt). It's why I'm spending a lot of time having now graduated relearning a lot of fundamental physiology and medicine by sitting down and properly studying these texts. 

Oftentimes I was just remembering enough key information from a power point slide to pass an exam. Now I am sitting down and reading, as an example, Nunn and Lumb's Applied Respiratory Physiology from front to back.

Perhaps I'm a particularly bad example of this but I feel that myself and many of my colleagues did not graduate with a meaningful understanding of what I would now describe as key concepts. As an example, I left vet school not really understanding the renin–angiotensin-aldosterone system pathways properly. Sure I could draw it out and name what was going on, but I didn't really understand it. It's only now that I've graduated that I could properly sit down and read Vander's that I've developed a better understanding of it.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that the curriculum in many vet schools is pretty lacklustre and the sheer volume of information you have to learn can result in a lack of meaningful understanding of many key concepts, resulting in them having to be learnt years after having graduated. This isn't to say that a graduate veterinarian is incompetent or stupid, just that a lot of learning will happen once they graduate.|Some schools it's much lower than that.

Once you prove yourself to be a good employee, you can see about transferring to the assistant position.|They're going to want to see evidence that you are reliable (show up on time? not call out for frivolous reasons?), have good common sense, and plan to stick around for a while. They're not going to want to invest time training someone then have them quit a week or two later once they learn that kennels are noisy and there's lots of poop to clean up.

To prepare, think of a few examples of times in the past where you've demonstrated responsibility, stuck with something despite periods of difficulty, or shown good observational skills that helped prevent a problem.

"The medical field can be ruthlessly competitive, even from the very start. As a med student, you're constantly compared to your peers, and any misstep can feel like a crushing blow. The pressure to excel is immense.

I remember feeling utterly exhausted and overwhelmed during my first few years of medical school. The workload is simply brutal, and it can feel like you're drowning in a sea of information.

Disrespect from patients is something I've had to learn to deal with over the years. There's a prevailing attitude that doctors are infallible, and any perceived misstep is met with anger and distrust.

It's ironic that we as medical professionals are expected to provide compassionate care, when the system itself can be so lacking in empathy. The long hours and high-stress environment can really take a toll.

I've noticed a troubling trend of physicians being treated more like technicians than healers. The focus on efficiency and productivity can come at the expense of genuine human connection.

Vet students and professionals definitely have it tough, but at least they're revered for their love of animals. As a doctor, I sometimes feel like the public just sees us as glorified mechanics.",Medical Doctor
"As a medical doctor, I can relate to the challenges and frustrations that come with starting out in the field. The brutality of the medical profession can be overwhelming at times, especially during the early stages of our careers. The long hours, sleepless nights, and constant pressure to perform can take a toll on our mental and physical well-being.

But let me tell you, despite the hardships, there is still something incredibly rewarding about being a doctor. We have the privilege of making a difference in people's lives, of providing care and compassion to those who need it most. The respect and trust that patients place in us is truly humbling.

However, it's disheartening to see the disrespect that can exist within the medical field. The hierarchy and power dynamics can sometimes overshadow the collaborative nature of healthcare. It's important for us to remember that we are all in this together, working towards a common goal of healing and helping others.",Medical Doctor

However, it's disheartening to see the disrespect that can exist within the medical field.

The hierarchy and power dynamics can sometimes overshadow the collaborative nature of healthcare.

In many ways, our experiences as medical doctors can be compared to those of veterinary professionals.

Both fields require immense dedication, perseverance, and a deep love for the work we do.

We witness suffering, pain, and loss on a daily basis, and it takes a strong heart to withstand the emotional toll.

Just like veterinary professionals, we also face the challenge of striking a balance between caring for our patients and caring for ourselves.

I've noticed a troubling trend of physicians being treated more like technicians than healers.

The focus on efficiency and productivity can come at the expense of genuine human connection.

As a doctor, I sometimes feel like we're just glorified mechanics, rather than compassionate healers.

The lack of respect from certain segments of the population is demoralizing.

We pour our hearts and souls into this profession, only to be met with suspicion and disdain from those we're trying to help.

I remember feeling utterly exhausted and overwhelmed during my residency.

The long hours, the constant pressure, and the emotional toll were almost too much to bear.

Vet students may have to deal with the realities of animal illness and death, but at least they're revered for their love of animals.

As a doctor, I sometimes feel like we're just cogs in a machine.

The constant fear of lawsuits and liability is a heavy burden to bear.

We're always on high alert, worried about making a mistake that could have devastating consequences.

I've had patients accuse me of misdiagnosing them or not listening to their concerns.

The lack of trust can be truly demoralizing, especially when you're giving your all.

Vet students may have to deal with the realities of animal euthanasia, but at least their patients can't verbally abuse them.

As a doctor, I've had to develop a thick skin to survive.

The lack of autonomy in the medical field can be frustrating.

We're often beholden to insurance companies, hospital administrators, and rigid protocols that can feel stifling.

I remember feeling like an imposter during my residency, constantly doubting my abilities and fearing I would make a catastrophic mistake.

The impostor syndrome is real, and it can be debilitating.

Vet students definitely have it tough, but at least they're revered for their love of animals.

There's a lot of disrespect towards junior doctors. You’re often treated as expendable, with little regard for your well-being. It can be disheartening, but it does get better over time.
